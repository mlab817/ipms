The IMEMS project is dedicated to set up an integrated operational fisheries and marine environment monitoring center in the Philippines.  Through this project, we will be able to monitor fishing vessels and combat illegal fisheries in order to protect the maritime resource in a sustainable way, support the national fishing industry, and promote seafood products for export.\r\nThe Project is in accordance to the thrusts and program of the government under the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 on Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries specifically to pursue an ecosystems approach to fisheries management including the conduct of regular nationwide fish stock inventory and assessment and strengthening measures against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and implement boat, vessel and gear registration and licensing, and monitoring of compliance with catch documentation among municipal and commercial fishing boats. Also, the implementation of the PHILO Project is in line with the implementation of a Monitoring Control and Surveillance System under RA 8550 as amended by RA 10654 to ensure a rational and sustainable development, management and conservation of the marine and aquatic resources.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to significantly improve and extend the existing capabilities of the BFAR Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and operationalize a Single Integrated National Marine Environment Monitoring System that is financially viable and scalable over the long term.","project_id":"19","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":100,"name":"Not Applicable"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":false,"cip_type":{"id":1,"name":"Locally-funded major capital programs\/projects with total project cost of at least PhP2.5 billion"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":true,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":2,"risk":"Implementation Risks:\n1.

Initially, the BFAR has already developed the program to equip and modernize municipal fisherfolk which proposed to provide by 2021 allocation of 49 units small to medium scale commercial fishing vessels to improve efficiency and increase production. This is in consideration that the fishing capacity of the municipal fishing boats may be considered relatively inadequate, with its operations mainly in coastal waters and with limited capacity and efficiency of applied fishing technologies.  \r\n\r\nIn complementation, the BFAR also implements the National Payao Program though the Tuna Conservation and Management Zone (TCMZ) project.  The program is implemented by the provisions of fish aggregating devices or payao to tuna handliners as livelihood assistance to improve their efficiencies and productivity. This is on top of the TCMZ\u2019s main objective to reduce incidence of juvenile tuna catches by designating exclusive areas for tuna handline only.","project_id":"17","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":100,"name":"Not Applicable"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":false,"cip_type":{"id":8,"name":"Not Applicable"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":false,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":65,"name":"Others"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":4,"risk":"The project may experience delays in procurement of supplies and materials for the livelihood intervention including limitation on physical conduct of training programs in the areas of consideration.

has been on the decline for the past several years.  It is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world.  Aquaculture production is more or less assured since it is generally under controlled conditions.  Advances in technology provide efficient schemes for climate proofing, optimum productivity and economic resiliency of communities.\r\n\r\nThe approval of this project will ensure that existing facilities are rehabilitated and improved so they will be able to operate fully.  It will also mean the installation of more facilities such as the establishment of additional submersible fish cages, seaweed and shellfish farms to increase fisheries production and attain fish sufficiency.\r\n\r\nThe project will also establish a toll processing facility that is GMP-SSOP and HACCP compliant.  This will serve fisherfolk associations composed mostly of women who do not have their own processing areas so that their products conform to food safety protocols.\r\n\r\nThe project will also invest in state of the art environmental monitoring equipment to guarantee the integrity of the production areas and its sustainability.  Last but not least, it will seek to continually upgrade the capabilities of its most important resource \u2013 the manpower composed of fisherfolk and other technical personnel from the BFAR and the LGUs so that the Project is properly managed and operated.","project_id":"18","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":8,"name":"Eastern Visayas"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":false,"cip_type":{"id":8,"name":"Not Applicable"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":false,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":65,"name":"Others"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":6,"risk":"The pandemic situation may limit the monitoring activities of the central agency due to access to field monitoring and cause delays in coordination with the funding agency.\n\nA project management office in the localized area in regional office can be established interim with staff to focus on the problems which may be brought about by the new normal due to pandemic.

1: Enhancing Year-round Leafy Vegetable Production Under Protective Cultivation in Laguna of Technical Cooperation Project entitled, \u201cIncrease of Philippine Farmers\u2019 Income Through Annual Production of Vegetables\u201d","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":7,"description":"Vegetables are valuable sources of vitamins A and C, iron, calcium, folic acid, and dietary fiber. It is also a profitable business for farmers since leafy vegetables are fast growing crops that are usually harvested within four to six weeks. However, vegetables are highly perishable crops that shall be sold in the market within a few hours of harvest. Therefore, vegetables are usually grown in peri-urban production areas (Talekar et. al, 2003). Aside from perishability, vegetable production is also threatened by climate related risks since the Philippines experiences extreme climatic conditions. \r\nThe climate in the country are classified into four based on rainfall distribution identified by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA). Under this classification, the Laguna province is under the Type I climate with two pronounced seasons. However, the region is prone to climate viability such as typhoons, torrential rains and flooding, and drought resulting to low agricultural incomes, high production risk, and market disruption.\r\nThe lack of innovative production systems, resource-efficient technologies and climate-resilient varieties are some of the constraints in the development of the vegetable industry in the country. One of the solutions for this problem is by adapting the use of protected structures.\r\nUse of protected structures is an important innovation that allows year-round production of vegetables, thus growers can enjoy higher returns per unit area. Moreover, it could reduce yield losses caused by insect pests, diseases and heavy rain, which results in higher productivity. Growers who cannot afford the high initial construction costs of net houses or plastic houses can grow vegetables under temporary net tunnels. The net tunnels are constructed with U-shaped iron or aluminium bars, which are covered with nylon netting over each bed (Talekar et al., 2003).\r\nMoreover, greenhouse technology is an important innovation that allows year-round production of domesticated plants including vegetables, less exposed to environmental constraints, and higher yield potentials with better quality.  However, further research, development, training and new norms are required because of the differences in climatic characteristics, cultivar-specific management requirements, and identification of new crops or varieties that will guarantee economic returns, cope with rapid changes in market trends, and consumer preferences including climate change.","project_id":"42","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":40,"name":"CALABARZON"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":2,"name":"Technical

Provide the country with greater capabilities to properly implement ocean laws and regulations, thereby safeguarding the dwindling and fragile marine resources in some of the critical parts of the Philippine waters and its 200 miles Exclusive Economic Zone;\r\n2. Provide deterrence against all forms of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities;\r\n3. Facilitate the collection of fisheries information, such as fishing effort, catches, and other pertinent data in the formulation of rational decisions, policies and laws regarding ocean planning, management and enforcement;\r\n4. Provide the country floating platform to continuously conduct MCS activities both within the Philippine waters but also in the high seas of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and; \r\n5. Increase the capability of the country to provide safety at sea to the fisherman during emergencies and conduct search and rescue operation when needed.","project_id":"20","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":100,"name":"Not Applicable"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":true,"cip_type":{"id":8,"name":"Not Applicable"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":true,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":8,"risk":"Implementation Risks:\n1.

to address key aspects of the market forces that drive overfishing. The project will add to the transformation of the seafood market by mainstreaming sustainability in the value chain of important commodities platforms, and fisheries improvement projects (FIP), developing national capacities, and generating learning to be shared worldwide. The project will allocate GEF resources strategically to 1) engage major seafood buyers in the main world markets (EU, Japan, US) into responsible sourcing, providing tools to prepare and implement sustainable seafood sourcing policies, 2) adapt the concept of green commodities platforms in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines to generate experience that could be used in other countries, 3) support stakeholders of these platforms to develop practical experience with fisheries improvement projects and upgrade existing tools for FIP implementation and monitoring, and 4) upgrade existing information platforms to facilitate access to reliable materials to value chain stakeholders in support of sound decision making, and capturing documenting and disseminating the learnings of the project. The project target fisheries include tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Mahi-mahi and large pelagic fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Indonesian snapper, Octopus and blue swimming crab fisheries in Philippines.\nThe project is an inter-regional intervention. Market engagement and knowledge management are global components. The sustainable marine commodities platforms and FIPs will be implemented, using a participatory approach in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and

build-up and establishment of milk processing centers. Through these herd build-up strategies, the existing underutilized government stock farms will be able to house more dairy animals. Also, more stock farms will be established to accommodate more dairy animals. Latest technology in animal breeding and milk collection will be made available in these farms\/centers. \r\n\r\nThe project moves along the programs of rural industrialization and industry dispersal as provided for in Republic Act 8435, also known as the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA). The establishment of milk processing centers and engagement in dairy farming will give opportunities for employment to residents in rural areas near the centers and farms and will reduce propensity to migrate to urban areas.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to contribute in the dairy industry development in the country, specifically:\r\n  - Contribute 95% of the national milk target (or 40% of the milk deficiency3) through sustainable production and processing of 125 tons of local milk daily by increasing the number of dairy animals by at least one (1) boatload (1,200 head) every year through importation and upgrade of local dairy cattle;\r\n  - To create livelihood and employment opportunities in accordance to the rural industrialization and dispersal programs provided for in the AFMA.","project_id":"268","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":3,"name":"Central

This will be a\r\nfive-day training wherein first day will be devoted on \r\nPublic Investment Program 2017-2022 &\r\nThree-Year Rolling Infrastructure Program 2022-2024\r\n2\r\nthe familiarization and use of RMS. Second day onwards\r\nwill be utilized on insect pest identification depending\r\non the program which Korean experts will provide. This\r\nis applicable to the initial training that would be\r\nconducted. The three (3) succeeding trainings would\r\ndepend on the insect groups that will be identified later.\r\nSame number of participants would attend the said\r\ntrainings.\r\nGeneral Objective:\r\n1. To strengthen the capability of the National Plant\r\nQuarantine Services Division (NPQSD) on efficient\r\napproach for insect pest identification\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n1. To equip six (6) NPQSD stations with remote\r\nmicroscopy system for monitoring and\r\nidentification of insect pests of regulatory\r\nsignificance.\r\n2. To enhance capacity and increase capability of 20\r\nPQ personnel on the identification of insect pest of\r\nregulatory significance.","project_id":"36","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":3,"name":"Central

They should also be monitored regularly by the third-party auditor.\n\nLack of competent manpower - Training should be done for prospective inexperienced operators. They can be trained in expert organizations\/institutes. SPFS can also be designed to use lower operator requirements as an alternative. \n\nLack of operating budget - Management should come up with a budget plan that coincides with the operation plan and provides enough resources for contingencies. \n\nNatural disaster - The design of the SPFS should be able to withstand the impact of natural hazards in order to minimize the disaster impacts. A disaster management plan should be in place in order for the operation to bounce back as soon as possible.","project_id":"44","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:32.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:32.000000Z"},"pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic

and advisory services, information, education and communication support services for farmers\u2019 groups and agricultural technicians of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and training services are among those banner programs of PhilFIDA. Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and\/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. \r\n\r\nData and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nVoice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nThe ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals. This also includes the proposed ICT organizational structure to cope with changing requirements and fast-paced technology.\r\n\r\nThis ISSP covers the Central Office, Laboratories, Experimental Stations and all Regional and Provincial Offices of PhilFIDA.","project_id":"56","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

line with the Republic Act 7900 (High Value Crops Development Act of 1995). This is an act to promote the production, processing, marketing and distribution of high value crops. HVCDP is a priority program of the Department of Agriculture created to help address food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth through increased farm income and productivity. The target service areas include convergence areas, strategic production zones and farm households. These areas need the interventions from the government in terms of production, extension, processing, marketing and regulatory support. The program is implemented yearly with a coverage of implementation down to barangay levels. The budgetary allocation for the implementation of PAP for the HVCDP is taken from the GAA with a cost sharing arrangement scheme.

This involves planting of high-value crops such as cacao, coffee, banana, corn, pineapple, and vegetables, among others in between spaces under the coconut trees. This is expected to generate additional income for the coconut farmers.\r\n\r\n2. Coconut Intercropping Project (Animal Integration and Dispersal) - Livestock raising and poultry farming under coconut is also encouraged to augment the income of the coconut farmers and to enhance the nutrition of the coconut farming households.

Dairy Herd Improvement Program (DHIP) is sometimes referred to as DHI, DHIA, or DHIR specifically for large animals. This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd\u2019s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to benefit some 150,000 dairy farmers and 200 organized

post-harvest, health and welfare. The BAI is mandated to implement programs for the development and expansion of livestock and poultry to meet the requirements of the growing populace and to make the local produce competitiveness in the global market. \n\nThe BAI has six (6) Research and Development Centers (RDCs) situated in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao which serve not only as centers for research and development concerning animal genetic improvement, but also as breeding facilities for preservation, conservation, and utilization of genetic materials. Each RDC cater specific commodity given the following names:\n\n\u2022\tNational Swine and Poultry Research and Development Center- Tiaong, Quezon\n\u2022\tNational Beef Cattle Research and Development Centers- Busuanga, Palawan; General Tinio, Nuevba Ecija; and Malaybala, Bukidnon)\n\u2022\tNational Small Ruminant Research and Development Center- Milagros, Masbate\n\u2022\tNational Feed Resource Research and Development Center- Bagalupa, Zamboanga Del Sur\n\nAlthough these RDCs are able to cater nationwide, there is a need for establishment of stock farm near urban areas which serve the purpose of availing to farmers\u2019 quality breeding stocks at affordable prices. With the country\u2019s cities growing rapidly, farming in and around urban areas play a bigger role in feeding city populations. \nGiven this situation, this necessitates the activation of BAI Tanay Stock Farm. The Tanay Stock Farm is the nearest location for any aspiring livestock and poultry farmers. The project aims at addressing the following constraints in the surrounding urban areas:\n1. Low Livestock Productivity\n2. Inadequate feed resources \n3. Inadequate skills and knowledge by the breeding workforce\n\nThe project seeks to establish Tanay Stock Farm as a center for breeding cattle, poultry, swine, and small ruminants, for the purpose of preservation, conservation, and utilization of genetic materials. This will also serve as a source of quality feed resources.  The tanay stock farm will support the surrounding communities with quality livestock breeds for all livestock and poultry commodities as well as build their capacity on animal production and farm management practices for sustainable and pro\ufb01table livestock enterprises. \nThe achievement of these will contribute to the overall sector objective which is food security.","project_id":"129","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government

learning environment for our animal health workers is equally important as providing quality animal health services to the public. One of the major challenges in providing quality public veterinary services is lack of infrastructures which serve as a venue to capacitate their knowledge and skills. An improved learning environment links to effective performance of our animal health workers. Lack of quality animal health services has a great impact on other economically important diseases that may cause heavy losses to livestock producers. Addressing diseases of public health importance effectively contribute to better health outcomes among communities and directly links to food safety. \n\nGuided with the main thrust of promoting animal health and welfare and strengthening regulatory services in the country, the establishment of Baguio Office Veterinary and Regulatory Development Centre, that will serve as a training centre to capacitate the knowledge and skills of our animal health workers on the proper protocol during animal health emergencies. Moreover, this will also serve as a training centre for regulatory activities among animal health workers at the Local Government Unit (LGU)\n\nProvide a training centre for the animal health workers to capacitate their knowledge and skills on animal health and welfare and regulatory services of the

Fever (ASF) has devastated the swine industry in the highly swine dense provinces in Regions III and IVA, spread to nearby regions in North and South of Luzon, with an incursion in Region XI. The outbreak that started in Rizal, Bulacan and now in some parts of Luzon and Mindanao area continue to pose significant threat to the swine industry. To date a total of 250,000 hogs have been killed to abate the spread of the disease. There is no effective vaccine or treatment and outbreaks can be devastating with the most virulent forms and can be lethal in 100% of infected animals.\r\n\r\nWith the ongoing disease situation, there is a need to augment and strengthen government capacity in disease monitoring and surveillance, quick response and disease control, laboratory testing, veterinary quarantine, information, education and communication of stakeholders for African Swine Fever. \r\n\r\nThis progamme will be implemented with the development and execution of a National ASF Prevention and Control Programme with the following components: \r\n\r\n1) Public Awareness\r\n2) Disease Monitoring and Surveillance, and \r\n3) Border Control and Movement Management. \r\n\r\nThe programme also aims to support and guide Regional, Provincial and Local Government Unit counterparts by providing necessary technical support to overall efforts in respective localities, as well as operational and logistic support to local veterinary offices.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great need to further enhance and equip the national and more so the 15 Regional Animal Disease Laboratories\u2019 (RADDLs\u2019) diagnostic capabilities for early disease detection and thereby preventing the occurrence or rapid spread in the country.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, the ASF testing services will be made available in the regions for the producers\/raisers to submit samples for assay. Samples need not be sent to the ADDRL for testing. This way, results can be had the shortest possible time so that control measures be implemented outright. This strategy will aide in controlling the spread of the virus rather than waiting for the results and letting the virus spread further. In controlling the spread, the farmers can still save their animals and have them sold rather than having the pigs indemnified.\r\nThis project aims to enhance activities on disease monitoring and surveillance, quick response and disease control, veterinary quarantine, information, education and communication of stakeholders for African Swine Fever through the implementation of a National ASF Prevention and Control Programme.\r\n\r\nTo equip the 15 Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories (RADDLs) and ADDRL (National Lab) in ASF disease diagnosis through training of diagnosticians on basic and advance PCR testing procedures, provision of new equipment, sufficient supplies and materials for early and rapid detection of the disease.","project_id":"132","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

database and systems for storage of these data to support creation of legislations.\r\n\r\nThis project will seek to identify, register and map animal facilities in Region III and Region IVA, which are considered as areas with dense farms, as well as Region NCR which contains many clinics and hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe project will therefore gather these data to be the baseline data for future projects and programs of the Bureau.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims for the following:\r\n\u2022\tTo survey animal facilities in Region III, Region IVA and NCR in collaboration with the different LGUs and DA Regional Field Offices;\r\n\u2022\tTo gather and create a baseline database of animal facilities in the selected regions that will be uploaded to the PhilAHIS system; and\r\n\u2022\tTo present a draft population map that could be used by decision makers as well as basis for future projects and programs of the Bureau.","project_id":"133","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

currently has four (4) different inspection systems for farms: the Animal Facility Registration as required under the Republic Act 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act, wherein all facilities are required

know the disease status of the farm and to facilitate safe transport of animals from one region to another; the Good Animal Husbandry Practices Certification Program, wherein farms are certified if they are in compliance with Food Safety Standards as required by the Department of Agriculture and therefore farms produces safe and quality food products; and the Breeder Farm accreditation, wherein farms are ensured to produce healthy and quality breeder animals.\r\n\r\nThe current system has become burdensome not only for farmers but for implementers as it requires multiple farm visits that presents biosecurity risks and loss of time for inspectors. Also, the different inspection systems have overlapping and redundant requirements. The procedure for application is also burdensome for the applicants which require multiple visits to the implementers\u2019 office. Database of the Bureau is also inadequate in the delivering of up to date data for the proper implementation of regulatory functions and services to the animal industry.\r\n\r\nThis proposal consists of three solutions to address the current problem of the Bureau:\r\n\u2022\tHarmonization of the different regulatory systems for farms of the Bureau of Animal Industry;\r\n\u2022\tCreation of the

following:\r\n\u2022\tTo better facilitate the regulation of farms in the country with streamlined and harmonized requirements;\r\n\u2022\tTo comply with the provisions of the Republic Act 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018;\r\n\u2022\tTo adapt the ISO\/IEC 17020 or the \u201cGeneral Criteria for the Operation of Various Type of Bodies

surveillance.","project_id":"134","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

Field Capacities for ASF Detection and Emergency Response","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":120,"description":"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease in susceptible species of the Suidae family, including domestic pigs and wild boar. Currently, there is no effective vaccine to protect swine from this disease and in its more virulent form can kill 100% of affected pigs. The ASF virus is very resistant and can survive long periods in very cold and very hot weather, and even in dried or cured pork products or carcasses. The threat of incursion of ASF into Asia has been a major concern as the region is the major pig production area with China alone being home to more than half the global population of swine. On 3rd August 2018, the first detection of ASF was reported from a pig farm in China. Until now, ASF has been subsequently reported in Mongolia, Viet Nam and Cambodia respectively. The high concentration of large-scale pig production farms, with associated value chains out of these high swine density areas, implies that the risk of spread within the country and into the region remains high, if the disease is not contained. Swine and swine product value chains are extensive with many connections at regional level for the purpose of commerce in meat and breeding. The potential further spread of ASF into other Southeast Asian countries now represents an imminent threat for the pig population in this region affecting pig and pork price, pig value chain and finally food security, particularly the populations with lower incomes. This project is specifically aimed to strengthen and activate the countries\u2019 preparedness including risk-based prevention and reduction as well as emergency response measures immediately to address the threat of ASF spreading to other parts of Southeast Asia. The project also aims to pilot a community-based approach to support smallholders to face risks and minimize impacts of ASF in an endemic situation\n\nProject Components:\n1.

country\u2019s capacity to control and prevent occurrence of animal diseases.\r\n\r\nSpecificObjectives\r\n\t\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are the following:\r\n1.\tTo create and improve databases of the animal industry of the Philippines;\r\n2.\tTo upgrade animal related registrations and permitting into online systems; \r\n3.\tTo integrate data from different databases that will provide valuable information to decision makers and stakeholders;\r\n4.\tTo create enabling policies in the use of the PhilAHIS; and\r\n5.\tTo advancethe capability of the Philippine government on animal disease prevention, forecast, quarantine, control and post management.\r\n\r\nC.\tMajor Components and Strategies\r\n\r\n1.\tImprovement of the PhilAHIS Data Center infrastructure and equipment\r\n\r\nThecurrent data warehousing facility of PhilAHIS has adequate functional capacity at this point to run the current version of the system. The proposed upgrade of the system, however, would need further improvement and modernization of thePhilAHIS Data Center\u2019s infrastructure and equipment. This should increase its capacity in order to house all the information that will be gathered from the project collaborators, counterparts and end-users, and to accommodate data management and traceability objectives of the proposed project. \r\n\r\nThe strategies proposed for this component are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tConstruction of an extension and renovation of the existing PhilAHIS building inside the BAI compound that will serve as the modernized Animal Data Center of the PhilAHIS. The facility shall include:\r\no\tServer rooms with adequate servers installed to run the upgraded PhilAHIS;\r\no\tExpanded office, living and storage space that will accommodate PhilAHIS staff and its additional functions; and\r\no\tImproved centralized command center for emergency animal disease responses.\r\n\u2022\tProcurement of adequate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and software and other related Information Technology (IT) components; and\r\n\u2022\tRecruitment and hiring of technical and IT personnel.\r\n\r\n2.\tSystem development and enhancement of PhilAHIS\r\n\r\nThe project aims to upgrade the current PhilAHIS to be a developed and integrated information system for all animal related data in the Philippines. This is envisioned to result in the significant improvement the veterinary services in the country. It will also elevate quality of industry reporting and government services of the DA and its livestock agencies. The creation of databases, information systems, applications and other technological solutions are proposed to achieve this aim.A technical working group (TWG) will be established that will guide the project proponents in the concept design and development of the information systems.\r\n\r\nThe name PhilAHIS will be retained for branding purposes, as this name has been known locally to all partner agencies and LGUs, including international partners such as OIE and the Food And Agriculture Organization(FAO) because of its use during the eradication program of FMD. This brand is also known to other ASEAN Member States (AMS).\r\n\r\nThe development of the PhilAHIS will contain the following strategies:\r\n\u2022\tCreation ofdatabasesand development of online systems in several regulations of the Animal Industry\r\no\tDevelopment of an online registration and application system of all animal facilities (e.g. farms), local animal transport vehicles, animal traders, meat establishments, meat transport vehicles and feed, drugs and biologics establishment;\r\no\tImprovement, design enhancement and upgrading of system features of the local shipping permit issuance system and the certificate of meat inspection issuance system; and\r\no\tIntegration of all databases into a monitoring system of animal population, and movement of animals, animal products and by-products.\r\n\u2022\tUpgrading of Disease Control and Surveillance information systems\r\no\tExpansion and modification of the existing PhilAHIS Field Monitoring System (desktop and web application) that records services of LGU personnel to farmers;\r\no\tCreation of an online animal disease reporting system through a web and mobile application for farmers, animal health workers, veterinarians, etc. that will facilitate ease of reporting and that will follow specific guidelines and protocols (e.g. all reports to be furnished to the BAI, DA Regional Field Offices (DA-RFO) and LGU);\r\no\tDevelopment of a Surveillance and Vaccination usage system that will incorporate all epidemiologic surveillance services of different animal health programs of the government; and\r\no\tInception of the Laboratory Information System that will provide results for all testing need doneby the government.\r\n\u2022\tImprovement of Disease Response and Resolution capabilities of the government\r\nImprovement of the PhilAHIS system that shall integrate data from baseline databases and results from disease control and surveillance to:\r\no\tAllow forecasting and risk analysis of disease outbreak;\r\no\tEnable use of data analysis and data visualizations such as charts and maps;\r\no\tAllow immediate communication from decision makers to ground personnel for disease response and quarantine measures; and\r\no\tAllow real time notice to livestock industry of outbreaks through technical bulletins passed thru different mediums.\r\n\u2022\tExpand and link PhilAHIS to other existing livestock information system from NMIS, PCC and NDA.\r\n\u2022\tMirroring of data to the DA ICTS Data Center\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tSystem Deployment\r\n\r\nThe development of the upgraded PhilAHIS will be in close coordination with the TWG. Upon drafting the final system, the PhilAHIS team and the TWG shall conduct the pilot testing of the upgrade PhilAHIS with the following respective order:\r\na.\tBAI and NMIS Central Offices;\r\nb.\tSelected DARFOs, PCC and NDA; and\r\nc.\tSelected PVOs, MVOs and CVOs.\r\n\r\nOnce pilot testing conducted is successful, and upon the approval and support of the steering committee, the team will move to deploy the system to the end users in geographical clusters with the following respective order:\r\na.\tNorth Luzon Cluster;\r\nb.\tSouth Luzon Cluster;\r\nc.\tVisayas Cluster; and\r\nd.\tMindanao Cluster\r\n\r\nIn a geographical cluster, the team will deploy the system and install all necessary equipment to all end users within the cluster, such as BAI \u2013 Veterinary Quarantine Offices, NMIS Regional Offices, DARFOs, and PVOs. The cluster deployment is strategized so as to minimize financial costs and time spent. A skeletal team will remain in the data center so as to resolve any issues relating to system deployment. After deployment, the team will conduct quarterly or biannual assessment, as determined necessary, of the success of the deployment and of the system.\r\n\r\n4.\tPolicy and Legislation Formulation\r\n\r\nThe data collection and utility of the proposed PhilAHIS improvement will not be only for the BAI but with the different stakeholders of the livestock industry such as national government offices such as the DA and its attached agencies (e.g. NMIS, PCC, NDA, DA RFO), LGU (e.g. Provincial, City and Municipal Veterinary Offices), academe, and the private sector. Formulation of policies in support of the system will be created with strategies as follows:\r\n\u2022\tCreation of a steering committee that will spearhead the implementation of the project;\r\n\u2022\tReview of existing policies and legislations on the collection of data for the system;\r\n\u2022\tCreation of policies and legislations to strengthen the use of PhilAHIS such as the assigning of rules and responsibilities on data collection to different government agencies and creation of respective technical working groups; and\r\n\u2022\tConsultation, and awareness campaign with different stakeholders that will utilize the system.\r\n\r\n5.\tCapacity Building\r\n\r\nThe programming team of the project will be sent to Korea through this project in order to be trained on the best practices in the implementation of KAHIS for several months. This will be vital in the enhancement and expansion of the system in the Philippines through the PhilAHIS.\r\n\r\nTechnical Veterinary team from the BAI and from collaborating agencies will be trained on disease prevention, forecast, quarantine, control and post-management in order to fully understand the KAHIS and to guide in the creation of the PhilAHIS.\r\n\r\nThe animal industry stakeholders such as LGUs and the possible users of the system will be trained in the use of the system in order to fully input correct data into the database and to fully utilize the system in their respective areas of jurisdiction.","project_id":"137","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

industry is dominated by backyard raisers which accounts for 3,716.350 or 98.68% of the total population.  The Ilocos Region is the top one producer of goats by backyard raisers which accounts for the 11.83 percent of the total goat inventory produced by backyard raisers (PSA, 2017). With this information, it is therefore proper to assist our backyard raisers in the control of diseases that may affect their animals. Although the prevalence rate of CAEV in Region 1, as per result of the just concluded surveillance research is quite low 2.6% or 13 out of 500 blood samples, this is a cause for alarm.  Since CAEV is a lingering viral disease transmitted through the milk, immediate diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and control is very essential. \n\nIt is therefore the immediate goal of this project to identify, eradicate and control not only CAEV but also other emerging and re-emerging diseases that threaten the well-being of the animal industry.  The project will also hone the skills of future veterinarians in laboratory diagnosis, disease monitoring and control. Furthermore the project will provide prompt diagnosis, eradication, treatment and control of animal diseases ultimately improving the status of the livestock industry in the region. \n\n1.\tTo provide reliable and timely results for CAE and other animal disease diagnostic services;\n2.\tTo provide proper monitoring  of CAE, emerging and re-emerging diseases and spread of diseases that threaten the profitability and marketability of livestock in the region;\n3.\tTo provide disease surveillance  information to livestock producers and companion animals so that prompt control measures can be immediately instituted to prevent spread of animal diseases;\n4.\tTo provide educational hands-on practice for future veterinarians on disease diagnosis;  and\n5.\tTo improve the performance and capability of the graduates of the College of Veterinary Medicine of DMMMSU.","project_id":"140","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government

address gaps related to laboratory biosafety and biosecurity identified during laboratory assessments (i.e.FAO-Laboratory Mapping Tool and OIE-PVS Evaluation)conducted by laboratory experts from international agencies. As product of trainings and assessments, there were recommendations that are critical in the implementation of biosafety and biosecurity in the national laboratories. In this project, the laboratories of the Veterinary Laboratory Division (VLD) premises and facilities will beimproved to mitigate the potential threat of intentional or unintentional introduction of pathogenic microorganisms and other hazardous implements to the environment, to the individuals working and availing the diagnostic services offered by the laboratories. \r\n\r\nThe VLD is compose of five (5) laboratories; the Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Lab. (ADDRL), the Veterinary Biologics Assay Lab. (VBAL), the Veterinary Biologics Production Lab. (VBPL), the Chemical Feed Analysis Lab. (CFAL) and the Veterinary DrugProduction and Assay Lab. (VDPAL).\r\n\r\nThe ADDRL is the national laboratory for animal disease diagnosis that serves as the model for the facilities in promotion and practice of biosafety to other laboratories complying to prescribed safety level standards. One that is acceptable with international counterparts with similar responsibilities that may translate to increased trust and confidence from its stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe VBAL, VBPL, CFAL and VDPAL are the laboratories responsible for the quality testing of imported\/locally-produced vet. biologics, vet. biologics production, feed analysis and vet. drug production\/assay respectively.\r\n\r\nAt present, the laboratories have their own disposal processes that are not within the acceptable standards but are likewise amenable. There is no designated area for the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) which is mandated by law. There is only one crematorium donated by USDTRA still for repair but spare parts unavailable. \r\n\r\nChemical wastes are neutralized and are poured into empty bottles and allowed to decay for sometime prior to disposal in the sewage. Howerver, for chemicals that cannot be neutralized are decanted in bottles and are placed in isolated areas prior to disposal by a third-party waste management service. \r\n\r\nAmong the activities covered in this project are the installation of the liquid waste treatment, composting facilities for solid wastes and CCTV, procurement of laboratory storage cabinets, thermal and sterilization equipment and repair of various laboratory-associated fixtures. \r\n\r\nThe laboratories are a probable source of disease-causing organisms that can harm the laboratory staff, clients, the whole community and livestock industries. The risk of intentional or unintentional release of infectious microorganisms to the environment are very high. Hazardous chemicals can also be released to the environment if not treated.  It is the aim of this project to improve the laboratories\u2019 capacity to mitigate or eliminate risks associated to laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.  \r\n\r\nWithin the year\u2019s implementation, it hopes to secure the laboratories and protect our livestock industry and the general public from possible harm of contracting infectious diseases or inhalation of hazardous chemicals. With the facilities to be installed and measures implemented, the risks shall be minimized and assurance of a safe workplace is achieved. The measures adapted will be evidenced by less absences, less incidents of sickness among workers and most importantly safety practices within the laboratory workplaces is achieved.","project_id":"141","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

Philippines. It is defined in RA 1556 as embracing all such articles to be used as feeds purporting to supply protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, antibiotics, growth promoting factors whether identified or unidentified and\/or correcting nutritional disorders. The AFVDBCD is the office in-charge in regulating feeds, feed products as well as veterinary drugs and biologicals. In order to cope with the assigned task the DA deputized officer in the Regions to assist in the implementation. But the constant turn-over of deputized personnel due to promotion, transfers, retirement, etc. handicapped the implementation of feed regulations. The deputized personnel have their own targets and functions within the Region and most of times they are multitasking. During emergencies like disease outbreaks they are called on to assist thereby the implementation of feed laws is left behind.\n\nThe delays in the issuance of licenses and registrations are a major consideration. Lack, incomplete or incorrect requirements\/attachments to the applications will not be processed; The application will be returned to the applicant for compliance and this cause the delay especially if the applicant is from the Regions. Under the Food Safety Act, the BAI is mandated to ensure food safety at the primary production and the function of ensuring feed safety rests in this office.

Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.\r\n\r\nThe Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.\r\n\r\nLocal Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Development: this component aims to engage broad sections of the sector in the production of marketable surplus through investments in strategic segments of priority commodity value chains and strengthening collaboration between DA and the Local Government Units. It shall strengthen and develop viable agri-fishery based enterprises through efficient value chain of key regional agri-fishery product.\r\n\r\nProject Support: this component aims to provide efficient and effective project management and implementation, establish a standard on services and technical assistance and effective mode of engagement with LGUs.","project_id":"149","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National Capital Region"},{"id":15,"name":"Cordillera Administrative Region"},{"id":1,"name":"Ilocos Region"},{"id":2,"name":"Cagayan Valley"},{"id":3,"name":"Central Luzon"},{"id":40,"name":"CALABARZON"},{"id":41,"name":"MIMAROPA"},{"id":5,"name":"Bicol Region"},{"id":6,"name":"Western Visayas"},{"id":7,"name":"Central Visayas"},{"id":8,"name":"Eastern Visayas"},{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga Peninsula"},{"id":10,"name":"Norther Mindanao"},{"id":11,"name":"Davao Region"},{"id":12,"name":"SOCCSKSARGEN"},{"id":13,"name":"CARAGA"},{"id":14,"name":"Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":true,"rdc_endorsement_required":"1","rdc_endorsed":true,"rdc_endorsed_date":"2016-04-12","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":31,"name":"Roads and Bridges"},{"id":41,"name":"Irrigation"},{"id":42,"name":"Water Supply"},{"id":64,"name":"Multipurpose Facilities"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":134,"risk":"(1) Project Stakeholders: The risks associated with resistance and\/or slow uptake of the institutional reforms in the DA on which PRDP is built on appears to be diminishing as project implementation proceeds.

Isabela","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":137,"description":"One of the strategies to promote local production of semen straws is the Establishment of the National Dairy Cattle Breeding and Artificial Insemination Center (NDCBAIC) in Isabela State University (ISU), Echague, Isabela. The Philippines has seen the effectiveness of such facility through the Bureau of Animal Industry\u2019s National Artificial Breeding Center (BAI-NABC) located in Bukidnon. Since BAI NABC prioritizes in processing semen for beef production, it would be plausible to establish a center dedicated to dairy cattle. This proposal aims to replicate the success of the Bukidnon breeding center in Northern Luzon. This is in anticipation of the growing dairy industry in the country and the infusion of more dairy stocks. The establishment of NDCBAIC in ISU in Echangue, Isabela will be one of the breakthroughs in the strengthening of the implementation of the NDA\u2019s breeding and upgrading programs in Luzon. \n\nThe cost to locally produce one straw of regular semen is cheaper at about P83.00 as compared to the cost of imported semen straws at about P750.00. At twice a week collection, the center will be able to produce some 49,920 semen straws annually costing about P4.14 million as compared to importing the same number which will amount to P37.44 million. \nISU is a very suitable host for the project since it has the following:\n\u2022 Existing Administration Building\n\u2022 Existing Bull Shed\n\u2022 Pasture\/Forage Development Area\n\u2022 Showroom of Technologies and Products\n\u2022 Training and IEC Center\n\nAs the project will also serve as a training center for its undergraduate and graduate agricultural and veterinary students including dairy farmers, ISU will not only vital in breeding dairy animals but also in \u201cbreeding\u201d the next generations of dairy technicians, dairy veterinarians and dairy farmers. \n\nHaving the project in ISU, NDA will strongly supports the bid of Echague LGU to become the Science and Ecological City of the North by 20222. Not far from the future, Echague could also be North Luzon\u2019s Dairy City (Dairy Hub). NDCBAIC will surely enhance and enrich ISU\u2019s mandates and functions along with its instruction, research, development, production and resources generation.\n \nOverall, the project is necessary to strengthen nation\u2019s war against malnutrition and poverty mitigation by creating more livelihood and opportunities through modern dairy agriculture. The project will be instrumental in increasing the national milk output by 24% and growing the Philippines Dairy Cattle Herd by 31% while training 200 undergraduate and graduate agricultural and veterinary students and serving 2,056 dairy farmers annually.","project_id":"153","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:29.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government Building"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":137,"risk":"Implementation Risk as follows:\n1.

There will be proper connecting roads of appropriate width and thickness to accommodate bigger and heavier machinery and equipment, as well as to ensure smooth coming in and out of raw materials  from the processing areas.On the other hand, the construction of a Material Recovery Facility, rehabilitation of electricals and drainage system, would ensure safety inside the PHilMech compound as well as

Ancestors of the present-day Philippine horse, which were either of Malay and Indian stock, were brought into the country by traders and travelers from Indonesia by way of Sulu or of Chinese bloodlines (Mackie, 1916). These horses were crossed to purebred horses brought in by successive colonizers with the purpose of improving the native breed as they were believed to be small in stature and considered not fit for military use. Horses that were considered \u201csmall\u201d were relegated to farm use, for hauling farm produce. Most of these horses were also depended upon as daily conveyance by those who cannot afford to own a horse.\n\nToday, horses still perform a significant role in agriculture and in our daily life. Known for their strength, speed, sure-footedness and intelligence, horses remain as the source of draft power in remote areas. The horse is also popular in equestrian sports such as racing, polo, pleasure-riding and rodeos which generate jobs that stimulate industry and promote tourism. When the need arises, it becomes an alternative source of protein and funds in emergency situations. Several towns still use horses to pull the calesa as an alternative to motorized transport and as a tool to promote tourism. Horse-fighting is also popular in some areas because of cultural practices. The horse is also expected to figure prominently in the promotion of agri-tourism. \n\nWith the important role of horses in Philippine agriculture, it is imperative that support be provided to harness its full potential as work animal, as a potential source of food and livelihood.\nThis project aims to conserve and improve the Philippine horse as a source draft power, food and livelihood.","project_id":"182","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":152,"risk":"0","project_id":"182","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:33.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:33.000000Z"},"pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter

disease with public health impact. At least 200 hundred Filipinos die yearly of Rabies infection. The only way to eliminate Rabies is by cutting the infection from its source, through mass dog vaccination. Mass dog vaccination is the most cost-effective way in eliminating disease and it only cost 10% of the total expenditure of eliminating rabies in humans. As stipulated in Republic Act 9482, DA-BAI is mandated to lead the elimination of the said disease. The national target, in line with the ASEAN target, is year 2020. The program will protect all Filipinos and other livestock animals from Rabies. The main activities stipulated in the Republic Act 9482 includes mass dog vaccination and registration, dog population management, control of stray dogs, enforcement of impounding activities and information dissemination campaign. This will ensure both food security and public health security, where farmers, fisher folks and their livestock animals may be affected. The implementers are currently giving its best effort to eliminate the said disease, but resources are still unsustainable since the disease directly affects the poorest of the poor areas, where there is limited access to human and animal health facilities.","project_id":"185","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

(VQS) was created and placed under the supervision of NVQSD for flexibility in the deployment of personnel to have easier coordination of veterinary services and quarantine strategies especially in times of epidemic threats and emergencies. The VQS serves as the frontliners on border protection; implement quarantine functions and regulate the movement of animals, their products and by-products including documentation and issuance of permit and commodity clearance for international, inter-regional, intra-regional and inter-island transport.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the mandated functions, VQS offices and strategic inspection posts are in place as follows: 16 Regional Veterinary Quarantine Stations, covering 133 terrestrial quarantine checkpoints, 128 domestic seaports, 9 international seaports, 25 domestic airports, 10 international airports and 4 satellite offices at NAIA, North Harbor, MICP and South Harbor. With the continuous threat of animal disease incursion from important notifiable diseases such as FMD and Avian Influenza amid continuing ASF disease challenge there is a need to strengthen border control strategies. To sustain the implementation of veterinary quarantine inspection procedures and regulations, adequate manpower, facilities and tools are critical. \r\n\r\nThe NVQS aims to enhance the delivery of services and its implementation of regulatory functions by (1)improving its facilities and inspection methods; (2)automate applications for local movement clearance and export veterinary health certificates to enhance client services delivery; (3)adapt technology that will enable efficient collation of movement data for the ease of backtracking and forecasting, particularly in the event of disease emergencies; (4) training and employee development; and (5)incorporate epidemiological studies on the introduction and spread of ASF, review the effectiveness of national and local government for controlling the spread of disease and assess the National Zoning Plan for better management of the disease. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the said objectives, the improvement program on the following areas are determined:\r\n\r\n1.\tVeterinary Quarantine Stations border improvement \r\n 1.1 Installation of Mobile Vehicle Disinfection Machine in key interregional checkpoints \r\n1.2 Institutionalization of foot mat in international and domestic ports \r\n1.3 Institutionalization of K9 sniffing dogs in critical ports in collaboration with the Philippine Coast Guard.\r\n1.4 Establishment of Ecologically, Economically acceptable and Sustainable Disposal system for confiscated commodities \r\n1.5. Establishment of a veterinary quarantine isolation center in Tanay, Rizal\r\n1.6 Veterinary Quarantine Policy Development\r\n\r\n2. Upgrading, expansion and maintenance of NVQS website and Online clearance application system\r\n2.1 Creation of Public Consultation online hub for new proposed policies\/guidelines of the NVQS\r\n\r\n3. Epidemiological Study on ASF and assessment of ASF disease control strategies to be done by 3rd party experts\r\n3.1 Establishment of Risk Assessment Unit under NVQS \r\n\r\n4. Personnel Enhancement Program & Stakeholder Engagement\r\n4.1 Retooling of NVQS Personnel\r\n4.2 Updating\/Orientation seminar for Clients \r\n4.3 Specialized Training of Veterinarians and other technical personnel\r\n4.4 Participation of employees to continuing education activities\r\n4.5 Public Consultation\r\n\r\n5. Hiring of additional Contract of Service Personnel to support  NVQS & VQS operations\r\nTo enhance the delivery of quarantine services and efficient implementation of qurantine regulatory functions to prevent the entry\/incursion of Transboundry animal diseases and control the spread of African Swine Fever disease in the country \r\n\r\nThe effective control and prevention of ASF and other TADs cases will eventually lead to regaining the ASF country freedom status and maintain the country\u2019s freedom status for TADs such as FMD and Avian Influenza.","project_id":"188","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

(GAHP) Certification Program of the Bureau of Animal Industry is the low level of awareness of farm owners and the non-mandatory state of the program which leads to low compliance from commercial farms and lack of GAHP standards for backyard farms.\n \nFood borne illnesses are usually caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances entering the body through contaminated food or water. To minimize the risks of food contamination, action is needed at all stages of the food chain, therefore early detection through laboratory tests will help us for the detection of food borne hazards of animal origin at the primary production phase.\n\nThis proposal is a way to minimize risks of food borne illnesses at the primary production phase and incentivize the certification program through provisions of free diagnostic test for the detection of food borne hazards and antimicrobial residues for GAHP certified farms.\n\n\nWith the approval of the Strategic Plan of the Food Safety Regulatory Agencies of the Department of Agriculture last October 2018. The Strategic Plan was summarized based on the Five (5) Pillars of Food Safety namely: Rules and Regulations, Food Control System, Enforcement Services, Laboratory and Epidemiological Data and Information, Education, Communication and Training.\n\nThis proposal aims for the following:\n\u2022\tTo facilitate the early detection, management and control of animal diseases in farms by providing free testing for GAHP certified farms for:\n\u2022\tSwine farms\n\uf0a7\tTrichenella\n\uf0a7\tAfrican Swine Fever\n\uf0a7\tHog Cholera\n\uf0a7\tBrucellosis\n\uf0a7\tTransmissible Gastroenteritis

Optimization, Validation and Adoption of Available Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for the Rapid Detection of selected economic (highly invasive) pests and diseases for ASEAN Member Countries","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":166,"description":"The Philippines has existing policies (Presidential Decree No. 1433) that would protect the export and import of agricultural products and commodities from harboring harmful pests and diseases. Consignments are subjected to quarantine inspection or verification to determine their phytosanitary condition. Importations that have been verified to be free from any of the quarantine pests and diseases shall be released to the importer upon the authorization of Plant Quarantine Officer. Similarly, domestic movement of agricultural products harboring insect pests and diseases are restricted unless freedom from pests is ensured or specific treatment is employed.\r\n\r\nNormally, quarantine inspection and laboratory examination typically lasts for 3-10 days depending on the type of test conducted. As a result, some products are hold in the port area that will cause a delay for their target date of shipment or release if found to contain damaging pest and diseases. \r\n\r\nIt was reported that one of the goals of ASEAN is to expand the trading opportunities of its member countries. Although, it will help ASEAN member countries to fully enhance their products, be engaged to various trading opportunities and to become globally competitive, member countries acknowledge the risk of introduction of exotic pests and diseases into their respective countries due to increasing volume of traded commodities that poses a significant threat on the agricultural industry (Capistrano, 2017).\r\n\r\nIn view of this, four (4) highly invasive insect pests and diseases which can pose a serious threat to agricultural industry in ASEAN member states have to be monitored to prevent its entry and spread in the entire region. These are Drosophila suzukii(spotted wing drosophila),Ceratitis capitate (Mediterranean fruit fly), Pseudomonas syringaepv. syringae (bacterial canker) and Cassava mosaic virus (CMV).  If not regulated properly and detection protocol is inefficient, the risk of its introduction to the Philippines and to other ASEAN member countries is imminent and ultimately threatens food security.\r\n\r\nIn addressing this pressing concern on invasive pests, BPI-NPQSD, with an established MBL that employs molecular techniques, realizes the importance of adoption of rapid detection protocol for the identified pests using available Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay. LAMP is regarded as an innovative gene amplification technology as substitute to PCR-based methodologies. It has been applied for the detection and identification of plant pathogens and other microorganisms that showed significant advantage due to its high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity. The most promising feature of this technology is the rapid and robust detection of the target nucleic acid without requiring sophisticated equipment. Reactions can be performed with limited resources, using a water bath for incubation and detection of results by the naked eye (colorimetric method) wherein it can give results that is comparable to modern PCR-based techniques (Li et al., 2017).\r\n\r\nThe said methods can be optimized and validated not only for the future use of the Bureau but also for the ASEAN member countries. Moreover, in pursuing an inclusive approach to accelerate the transformation towards a modern and industrialized Philippine agriculture, the Department of Agriculture (DA) is implementing critical strategies for 2021 (DA Communications Group, 2021a). One of the twelve (12) key strategies to firm up the \u2018One DA\u2019 framework is the \u201cIntensification of Food Safety Protocols and Regulations\u2019 (DA Communications Group, 2021b). As per this strategy, the DA will focus its funding and effort in mitigating the effects of plants and animal diseases through improvement of laboratory and research facilities, building traceability, and unifying control measures against plant and animal epidemics (DA Website). This project is highly supportive with this strategy through strengthening the regulatory capability of the division and improvement of effectivity and efficiency of detection of pest of quarantine significance.","project_id":"196","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[{"id":100,"name":"Not

LC-MS-MS -  for screening and confirmation of almost all types of pesticides\r\n2. GC-FPD - for analysis of low molecular weight organo-phosphorus containing pesticides\r\n3. GC-ECD -  for analysis of low molecular weight organo-chlorine containing   pesticides and pyrethroids\r\n4. Medical freezers \u2013 for storage of pesticide standards and samples\r\n5.

In addition, hands on training, maintenance and troubleshooting, evaluation and interpretation of the data obtained will also be conducted. These trainings are part of the package in the procurement of the equipment.\r\n\r\nMethod development and validation of analytical methods will be conducted as soon as the equipment are installed. The method development will be done on a per instrument basis while validation will be on a crop \/ pesticide basis and will follow international protocol in order to produce reliable and accurate results.  Actual implementation of the project will be conducted through the analysis of crops (300 samples for the whole project duration) both imported and local.  Monitoring of imported commodities, particularly apples, pears, oranges and grapes, consumed fresh will be conducted in local markets and in borders through the National Plant Quarantine Services Division (NPQSD).  Monitoring of commodities in the local markets will be enhanced.  This enhanced monitoring will ensure safe food for the Filipinos as well ensure detection of pesticide residues prior to exportation of crops, thereby resulting to reduced detections and detentions of our commodities in importing countries.","project_id":"213","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National

the Korean government in 2013-2016 implemented through a project titled, \u201cEnhancing the Capacity for Production and Distribution of High-Quality Rice Seeds\u201d. As PhilRice CES  expanded its area for seed production, from 34 hectares in 2016-2020 to 52 hectares, it will require additional facility to complement and sustain performance efficiency. \r\n\r\nConcerns on untagged seeds that are proliferating will partly be addressed by the rice seed information system (RSIS) which is a component of this project. With RSIS portal serving as repository of important data\/information, the stakeholders will be guided as to the availability of high-quality seeds which can be accessed anytime.\r\n\r\nThe NFA\u2019s ICT-based buffer stock management system, on the other hand, will need the hardware and software to improve its operations. It will equip the personnel with gadget and in using the ICT software so they can provide the status of milled rice inventories in the regional warehouses at a given time. The stakeholders will be kept abreast of the situation of each of the NFA stations so augmentation of stocks from one place to another may be facilitated within reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nOnce these facilities, systems, and hardware are in place, the Philippine government will be kept informed for planning and decision making on matters pertaining to rice production and seed requirements and sources, palay procurement schedules, and milled rice stocking and distribution system. Hence, this project will\r\nprovide great contribution and impact to achieving a seed-secure toward a food-secure

enhancement of milk production through the infusion of purebred and crossbred dairy stocks, use of advanced breeding technologies and establishment\/strengthening of community-based dairy enterprises within identified impact dairy zones. This is in support to the Department of Agriculture (DA)\u2019s current development strategy of \u201cNew Thinking for Agriculture\u201d and new vision of a \u201cfood secure Philippines with prosperous farmers and fishers\u201d. Moreover, the farm consolidation or clustering approach will be done encouraging farmers to consolidate\/cluster their dairy animal farming activities thereby enhancing access of these farmers to technologies, financing and markets. \r\n\r\nConsistent with the objectives of the agriculture sector in expanding economic opportunities in agriculture, the project aims to: 1) produce 27.70 Million Liters of milk throughout the project period; 2) increase dairy cattle inventory by 7,323 heads and dairy goat inventory by 9,611 heads through importation and expanded animal breeding programs; 3) increase dairy carabao inventory by 922 heads through importation and local procurement of purebred\/crossbred buffaloes; 4) increase production of female calf by 8,562 heads annually through expanded AI services utilizing the semen sexing technology; 5) increase average family income of dairy farmers by 20% annually through the development of carabao-based dairy enterprises; and 6) increase the average income of dairy goat farmers by 18% and double the income of dairy cattle farmers throughout the project period with the establishment and enhancement of goat-based and cattle-based dairy enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn laying down the strategies to be implemented throughout its duration, the following are the major components of the project: a) Dairy Animal Procurement and Distribution; b) Expanded Artificial Insemination; c) Feed Production and Development; d) Dairy Enterprise Development; e) Capacity Building; and f) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will be implemented by the National Dairy Authority (NDA) and Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) with the DA-National Livestock Program (NLP) as the oversight office for four (4) years. It will be sustained and monitored through collaborations with various cooperating agencies.","project_id":"254","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":1,"name":"Ilocos Region"},{"id":2,"name":"Cagayan Valley"},{"id":3,"name":"Central Luzon"},{"id":5,"name":"Bicol Region"},{"id":6,"name":"Western Visayas"},{"id":7,"name":"Central Visayas"},{"id":8,"name":"Eastern Visayas"},{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga Peninsula"},{"id":10,"name":"Norther Mindanao"},{"id":11,"name":"Davao Region"},{"id":12,"name":"SOCCSKSARGEN"},{"id":13,"name":"CARAGA"},{"id":14,"name":"Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao"},{"id":15,"name":"Cordillera Administrative Region"},{"id":40,"name":"CALABARZON"},{"id":41,"name":"MIMAROPA"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":false,"cip_type":{"id":8,"name":"Not Applicable"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":true,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government Building"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":187,"risk":"Implementation Risk as follows:\n1.

Intensified Community-based Dairy Enterprise","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":189,"description":"The dairy industry is one of the components of the Philippine agriculture which is considered vital in the economic and nutritional development of the nation.  In the past years, the government had initiated several interventions to support and boost the industry.  However, these efforts are not enough to level up the production  as the local dairy industry at present is just able to supply 1.3% of the total milk demand of the country. The current dairy animal inventory is insufficient to satisfy the dairy requirements of the consumers.\r\n\r\nThe passage of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11037, otherwise known as the \u201cMasustansyang Pagkain para sa Batang Pilipino Act\u201d and R.A. No. 11148 or the \u201cKalusugan at Nutrisyon ng Mag-Nanay Act\u201d provided directions for the DA, particularly the NDA and the PCC, to encourage farmers to raise more dairy animals to supply the demand for locally produced milk through milk feeding programs for public kindergarten and elementary schools and public daycare as well as help boost livelihood opportunities for local dairy farmers, in particular, and the local dairy industry, in general.\r\n\r\nOf the 24.4 million liters of locally produced milk, 60% are sourced from cattle while 36% are sourced from buffaloes and 4% are sourced from goats. While cattle has the largest portion in herd inventory and local milk production, there is a rise in interest in dairy goat farming due to low cost of raising dairy goats. Likewise, carabao dairying continues to prove its potential with almost doubled nutrients of cow\u2019s milk making it easier for carabao milk and milk products to enter the local market.\r\n\r\nWith the abovementioned considerations, a restructuring of the US PL480-funded project entitled \u201cDairy Goat Farming: A Livelihood Opportunity for Rural Farm Families\u201d  which was approved by the US Government on October 11, 2018 is being proposed.  The restructuring would include dairy buffalo and cattle, in addition to dairy goat, with the aim to accelerate the improvement of the entire industry through increased production and enhanced genetics of these animals leading to increase local milk production. Overall, the program will help in the national government\u2019s efforts to address poverty, hunger and malnutrition. It will be entitled \u201cIntensified Community-Based Dairy Enterprise Development\u201d and will be implemented by the NDA and PCC. \r\n\r\nThe project intends to create the aforementioned impacts through the infusion of purebred dairy stocks and the use of advanced breeding and reproduction technologies. Procurement of locally available purebred\/crossbred buffaloes in addition to the importation of purebred dairy stocks will also be done due to limited stocks from Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)-free countries. Likewise, the establishment and strengthening of additional dairy enterprises are deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nOverall, the above-mentioned initiatives are in line with DA\u2019s current development strategy of \u201cNew Thinking for Agriculture\u201d and new vision of a \u201cfood secure Philippines with prosperous farmers and fishers\u201d supportive of the farm consolidation or clustering approach by encouraging farmers to consolidate\/cluster their dairy animal farming activities through communal farms, thereby enhancing access of these farmers to technologies, financing and markets. \r\n\r\nWith the directives to support the Philippine Dairy Industry and push for attaining higher sufficiency levels in terms of milk production, all efforts to increase local milk volumes and its sources are being exhausted, hence this project.","project_id":"255","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":2,"name":"Cagayan

National Farmers and Fisherfolk Information System (NFFIS), covers the following components: updating of the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA); nationwide farm lot georeferencing; and development of Interventions Monitoring System.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to create a centralized and nationwide farmers and database that would support vaious levels of planning, decision-making, and delivery of interventions for the Department of Agriculture. The database contains information on farmers, farm laborers, and fishermen and their farm parcels. The database can significantly improve the delivery of programs and services of the Department of Agriculture while making the data available to other agencies that share the same stakeholders as the DA. The activities include the conduct of nationwide validation and registration of farmers and updating of the existing farmers' registry.\r\n\r\nThe nationwide farm lot georeferencing will link the farmer profiles to farm lots. This will validate farm areas for intervention distribution and verify the total production areas.\r\n\r\nFarmer's ID card or Intervention Monitoring Card will serve as the standard identification system for all registered farmers. The intervention monitoring card can be used as a first-level validation and authentication of DA beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe project will require technical assistance from a consultancy firm to hire, train and deploy staff that will conduct the farmer and fisherfolk updating, registration and profiling, and conduct farm parcel georeferencing. Given the scale of the project, it will be difficult for the DA to implement the project on its own. To ensure the alignment of the technical assistance to the intention of the project , the Secretary will issue guidelines for its implementation. Project Management teams shall be formed at the national level including a National Steering Committee, National Project Technical Working Groups, and National Project Management Office. The DA-RFOs will create their own project implementation offices to oversee and provide technical assistance at the regional level.

- Strengthening Capacities of Dairy Farmers & Extension Workers","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":{"id":202,"description":"The National Dairy Authority (NDA) was established in 1995. It is the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry through policy direction and program coordination and implementation. The main goal of the NDA is to establish a profitable, competitive and sustainable growing dairy industry built on financially viable business performance throughout the value chain, providing good quality of life for farmers and ensuring consumers safe and quality milk and milk products.Majority of the Philippines\u2019s annual dairy requirement is supplied by importers and processors. Local production continues to increase annually but not enough to cover local demand. In 2017 it imported 417,07 million kilograms of milk by 185 importers, processors and traders. In same year local production was only 22,76 million kilograms of milk. Milk is third largest agri-import.Philippines\u2019s dairy sector represents a big potential for an improvement of a quality of life in rural areas. Development of milk production will have positive effects on unemployment rate and socio-economic situation in rural areas.  The NDA is given very limited funds every year to capacitate a total of 2,418 dairy farmers in dairy production and management. The lack of funds contributed to the very limited technical assistance the NDA can provide to these dairy farmers resulting to wrong practices and not enough knowledge to run a dairy enterprise and make it profitable.\n\nThe NDA is focused on improvement of situation. In 2017, the NDA and Czech Republic\u2019s Development Assistance (program Aid for Trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) have started a new project focused on situation of dairy sector in Philippines - \u201cAssistance in analyzing and improving value chains in the dairy industry in Philippines\u201d. In scope of the project, Czech dairy experts have visited Philippines\u2019s farms. They have identified three main issues that are complicating development of dairy industry in Philippines:\ninsufficient capacities of extension workers\n- insufficient capacities of dairy farmers \n- insufficient promotion of local (Philippines\u2019s) production and consumption\n\nThe proposed project is consistent with and directly supports the NDA Charter Statement and Strategy Map (Annex A) of improving the stakeholders\u2019 welfare, ensuring the enforcement of dairy quality standards from production to post-harvest, advocate for the patronage of local milk and milk products and enhancing the competency of NDA manpower and farmer-clients.\nFinally, the proposed project will help realize the Philippine Agriculture\u2019s goals of expanding opportunities for those engaged in agriculture production and increasing access of small and subsistence farmers to economic opportunities as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP)

labor-intensive farming activity unlike crop farming.  Government investments have always been hugely spent for rice and high value crops while dairy programs were minimally funded in comparison.  \r\n\r\nStatistics show that despite the lack of investments, the growth of the dairy sector has been at an average of 6.3% (2010-2015).  Small hold dairy farmers have considered dairy farming as their livelihood that can provide for their families needs.  The most compelling reason why dairy farmers continue to pursue dairying as a living is profit.\r\n\r\nThe government, the private sector and future dairy players need to be convinced that dairy farming and all of its related activities are profitable, hence, need investments.  The local dairy industry needs to be promoted as one of the agricultural commodity poverty reduction driver particularly in the rural areas.  Studies shall be documented and backed up by scientific evidence to firm up the cause, hence, this study.","project_id":"284","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":15,"name":"Cordillera Administrative Region"},{"id":1,"name":"Ilocos Region"},{"id":2,"name":"Cagayan Valley"},{"id":3,"name":"Central Luzon"},{"id":40,"name":"CALABARZON"},{"id":41,"name":"MIMAROPA"},{"id":5,"name":"Bicol Region"},{"id":6,"name":"Western Visayas"},{"id":7,"name":"Central Visayas"},{"id":8,"name":"Eastern Visayas"},{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga Peninsula"},{"id":10,"name":"Norther Mindanao"},{"id":11,"name":"Davao Region"},{"id":12,"name":"SOCCSKSARGEN"},{"id":13,"name":"CARAGA"},{"id":14,"name":"Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":"6","approval_level":{"id":6,"name":"Not Applicable"},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":{"id":203,"risk":"Risk and Mitigation Strategies\n1.

of the century, two outbreaks of coronaviruses were observed. The two corona outbreaks were Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (WHO, 2004) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (WHO, 2019).  \r\nIn December 2019, group of patients were hospitalized due to pneumonia with unknown cause. After thorough investigation, the unknown disease was linked epidemiologically from a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It was later found out that the mysterious disease is caused by a virus from the Betacoronavirus family that is related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It was later given the name COVID-19 as it stands for \u201cCOrona VIrus Disease 2019\u201d (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). \r\nIn some reports, it was observed that not only human can be infected or carry COVID-19, however, animals are suspected to carry asymptomatically the virus but animal to human transmission have not yet been demonstrated. However, screening of animals for COVID-19 has not yet been done (CDC, 2020). Although there are still no known reports of animal mortality due to COVID-19 and transmission between animals may still have no great impact on livestock trade and industry, that fact is that animal to human transmission is already existing. Humans working in the livestock trade are getting infected and their absence from overseeing the trade has crippled the industry and is a risk to food security.  \r\nCurrent diagnostic test and protocols for COVID-19 included Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction and Antibody test A.K.A \u201crapid test kits\u201d. RT-PCR detects a specific gene or protein of the virus to confirm its presence in the host however, this test has disadvantage of needing meticulous steps to prepare the sample and a need of specialized equipment. On the other hand, rapid test kits can be brought to the field however the test may have false positives or still detect the disease even in recovered patients (CDC, 2020).\r\nWith this, this project aims to develop a prototype nanotech-based test kit that can detect COVID-19 for livestock and companion animals. In addition, the project aims to augment the existing diagnostic options with a field molecular kit complexed with nanotechnology.","project_id":"287","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":3,"name":"Central

equipment which are considered valuable inputs particularly in forage production and pasture development.  While such equipment offers a wide range of benefits in terms of developing and increasing production of forage for dairy animals, not all dairy farmers have the capacity to purchase their own equipment taking into account the financial obligations that they need to fulfil in managing their respective farms.\r\n\r\nAs the agency mandated to accelerate the development of the local dairy industry, the NDA is committed to providing the local dairy farmers the access to various dairy equipment and facilities that can be of great help in improving their dairy farm operations. It is in this light, that the NDA would like to propose the provision of one (1) agricultural tractor, one (1) forage chopper, one (1) truck, and one (1) warehouse to each of the six (6) Regional Departments of the NDA namely, Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Southern Mindanao. \r\n\r\nThe NDA shall be the executing agency of the project whose major tasks include: formulating rules and guidelines as regards to the use of the tractor and forage chopper; deployment of the equipment to the requesting farmers\/farmers' groups; overall maintenance of the equipment; and conduct of regular monitoring of the project. \r\n\r\nThe NDA uses this proposed project as the vehicle to support local dairy farmers in their goal of further enhancing dairy farm operations to achieve better milk yield and ensuring the availability of feeds for dairy animals. In addition, the agency seeks to develop more contract growers to serve as feeds source of the local dairy farmers and contract growers for specialized skills in calf rearing and grow-out farming. \r\n\r\nThe tractors, trucks, and forage choppers would be provided on hire basis to the local dairy farmers through the NDA Regional Department assisting them.

Infrastructure\r\n\r\n1. Establishment of Dairy Marketing Centers \r\na. These marketing centers, equipped with chillers, shall be established within existing NDA-assisted dairy zones or dairy areas. It must be situated in strategic areas or commercial centers where local consumers can easily access the products. \r\nb. Dairy farmers can go to these dairy marketing centers to sell their products. Since smallhold dairy farmers will undergo capability training on home based processing, they will be able to process their own products, sell through these marketing centers and earn more income.  \r\nc.  The NDA will initially oversee the center under its Business Development Unit and eventually tap the NDA trained personnel of the Federation or dairy cooperatives to manage or run the centers. The dairy cooperatives\/federations\/private entities shall pay corresponding commissioned-based fees to NDA for every product sold in the center. The fees collected will go back to the marketing centers to cover the maintenance costs.\r\nd. NDA will continuously monitor the marketing centers.\r\n\r\n2. Establishment of Dairy Post-harvest facilities \r\na. Post-harvest facilities such as milk collection centers with cold storage equipment shall be established to ensure the quality of milk collected for processing plants. \r\nb. Farmers can go to these collection centers and sell their raw milk produce and the collection center will bring the milk to the milk processing plant.\r\nc. The NDA will establish these milk collection centers and shall be leased (Lease to own scheme) to cooperatives or federations.\r\nd. Through a partnership forged between the federation or cooperatives and the marketing center thru NDA, products from the milk processing plants will be supplied to the marketing centers.\r\n\r\nB. Capacity Building\r\n\r\nAs the country recognizes the need to develop its dairy industry, priority programs such as training programs for dairy farmers and cooperatives shall be enhanced. Dairy sector\u2019s competiveness and capacities will be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. The following trainings will be conducted:\r\na. Homebased Milk Processing\r\nb. Milk Quality Assurance\r\nc. Business Management (Accounting & Bookkeeping)\r\nd. Milk Marketing\r\ne. Trainings on other business opportunities (meat processing (for male calves), vermi-culture, biogas, forage production)\r\n\r\nThis project aims to enhance existing dairy-based livelihood particularly on milk collection, processing and marketing to make dairying a sustainable source of income for dairy farmers. It intends to promote the marketability of locally produced milk and milk products.","project_id":"293","created_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T04:41:30.000000Z"},"expected_outputs":null,"spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":16,"name":"National
