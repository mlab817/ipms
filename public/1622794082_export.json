The IMEMS project is dedicated to set up an integrated operational fisheries and marine environment monitoring center in the Philippines.  Through this project, we will be able to monitor fishing vessels and combat illegal fisheries in order to protect the maritime resource in a sustainable way, support the national fishing industry, and promote seafood products for export.\nThe Project is in accordance to the thrusts and program of the government under the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 on Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries specifically to pursue an ecosystems approach to fisheries management including the conduct of regular nationwide fish stock inventory and assessment and strengthening measures against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and implement boat, vessel and gear registration and licensing, and monitoring of compliance with catch documentation among municipal and commercial fishing boats. Also, the implementation of the PHILO Project is in line with the implementation of a Monitoring Control and Surveillance System under RA 8550 as amended by RA 10654 to ensure a rational and sustainable development, management and conservation of the marine and aquatic resources.\n\nThe project aims to significantly improve and extend the existing capabilities of the BFAR Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and operationalize a Single Integrated National Marine Environment Monitoring System that is financially viable and scalable over the long term.","expected_outputs":"Compliance to fisheries policies and regulations, traceability of catch, safety of fisherman at sea and curbing Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing activities.","spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Implementation Risks:\n1.

Initially, the BFAR has already developed the program to equip and modernize municipal fisherfolk which proposed to provide by 2021 allocation of 49 units small to medium scale commercial fishing vessels to improve efficiency and increase production. This is in consideration that the fishing capacity of the municipal fishing boats may be considered relatively inadequate, with its operations mainly in coastal waters and with limited capacity and efficiency of applied fishing technologies.  \n\nIn complementation, the BFAR also implements the National Payao Program though the Tuna Conservation and Management Zone (TCMZ) project.  The program is implemented by the provisions of fish aggregating devices or payao to tuna handliners as livelihood assistance to improve their efficiencies and productivity. This is on top of the TCMZ\u2019s main objective to reduce incidence of juvenile tuna catches by designating exclusive areas for tuna handline only.","expected_outputs":"1.

production shortfall in capture fisheries that has been on the decline for the past several years.  It is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world.  Aquaculture production is more or less assured since it is generally under controlled conditions.  Advances in technology provide efficient schemes for climate proofing, optimum productivity and economic resiliency of communities.\n\nThe approval of this project will ensure that existing facilities are rehabilitated and improved so they will be able to operate fully.  It will also mean the installation of more facilities such as the establishment of additional submersible fish cages, seaweed and shellfish farms to increase fisheries production and attain fish sufficiency.\n\nThe project will also establish a toll processing facility that is GMP-SSOP and HACCP compliant.  This will serve fisherfolk associations composed mostly of women who do not have their own processing areas so that their products conform to food safety protocols.\n\nThe project will also invest in state of the art environmental monitoring equipment to guarantee the integrity of the production areas and its sustainability.  Last but not least, it will seek to continually upgrade the capabilities of its most important resource \u2013 the manpower composed of fisherfolk and other technical personnel from the BFAR and the LGUs so that the Project is properly managed and operated.","expected_outputs":"1. 10 units of fish cages and 10-cell grid mooring system\n2. 60 units of floating guard house\n3. 60 units harvest platforms\n4. 240 modules of shellfish or seaweeds\n5. hatcheries\n6. nurseries\n7.

1: Enhancing Year-round Leafy Vegetable Production Under Protective Cultivation in Laguna of Technical Cooperation Project entitled, \u201cIncrease of Philippine Farmers\u2019 Income Through Annual Production of Vegetables\u201d","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":"Vegetables are valuable sources of vitamins A and C, iron, calcium, folic acid, and dietary fiber. It is also a profitable business for farmers since leafy vegetables are fast growing crops that are usually harvested within four to six weeks. However, vegetables are highly perishable crops that shall be sold in the market within a few hours of harvest. Therefore, vegetables are usually grown in peri-urban production areas (Talekar et. al, 2003). Aside from perishability, vegetable production is also threatened by climate related risks since the Philippines experiences extreme climatic conditions. \r\nThe climate in the country are classified into four based on rainfall distribution identified by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA). Under this classification, the Laguna province is under the Type I climate with two pronounced seasons. However, the region is prone to climate viability such as typhoons, torrential rains and flooding, and drought resulting to low agricultural incomes, high production risk, and market disruption.\r\nThe lack of innovative production systems, resource-efficient technologies and climate-resilient varieties are some of the constraints in the development of the vegetable industry in the country. One of the solutions for this problem is by adapting the use of protected structures.\r\nUse of protected structures is an important innovation that allows year-round production of vegetables, thus growers can enjoy higher returns per unit area. Moreover, it could reduce yield losses caused by insect pests, diseases and heavy rain, which results in higher productivity. Growers who cannot afford the high initial construction costs of net houses or plastic houses can grow vegetables under temporary net tunnels. The net tunnels are constructed with U-shaped iron or aluminium bars, which are covered with nylon netting over each bed (Talekar et al., 2003).\r\nMoreover, greenhouse technology is an important innovation that allows year-round production of domesticated plants including vegetables, less exposed to environmental constraints, and higher yield potentials with better quality.  However, further research, development, training and new norms are required because of the differences in climatic characteristics, cultivar-specific management requirements, and identification of new crops or varieties that will guarantee economic returns, cope with rapid changes in market trends, and consumer preferences including climate change.","expected_outputs":"\u2022 Conducted on-station

These vessels will be constructed with a steel hull and will be equipped with propulsion, auxiliary engines\/machineries with state of the art navigational and communication equipment to perform monitoring, control and surveillance of the Philippine marine waters including the 200 nm EEZ and the high seas.\t\n\nThis project aims to:\n1. Provide the country with greater capabilities to properly implement ocean laws and regulations, thereby safeguarding the dwindling and fragile marine resources in some of the critical parts of the Philippine waters and its 200 miles Exclusive Economic Zone;\n2. Provide deterrence against all forms of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities;\n3. Facilitate the collection of fisheries information, such as fishing effort, catches, and other pertinent data in the formulation of rational decisions, policies and laws regarding ocean planning, management and enforcement;\n4. Provide the country floating platform to continuously conduct MCS activities both within the Philippine waters but also in the high seas of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and; \n5. Increase the capability of the country to provide safety at sea to the fisherman during emergencies and conduct search and rescue operation when needed.","expected_outputs":"Acquisition and manufacturing of six (6) units of MMOV","spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":{"id":1,"name":"Capital Investment Program and Project"},"research":false,"cip":false,"ifp":true,"cip_type":{"id":8,"name":"Not Applicable"},"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":true,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Implementation Risks:\n1.

The project will add to the transformation of the seafood market by mainstreaming sustainability in the value chain of important commodities platforms, and fisheries improvement projects (FIP), developing national capacities, and generating learning to be shared worldwide. The project will allocate GEF resources strategically to 1) engage major seafood buyers in the main world markets (EU, Japan, US) into responsible sourcing, providing tools to prepare and implement sustainable seafood sourcing policies, 2) adapt the concept of green commodities platforms in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines to generate experience that could be used in other countries, 3) support stakeholders of these platforms to develop practical experience with fisheries improvement projects and upgrade existing tools for FIP implementation and monitoring, and 4) upgrade existing information platforms to facilitate access to reliable materials to value chain stakeholders in support of sound decision making, and capturing documenting and disseminating the learnings of the project. The project target fisheries include tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Mahi-mahi and large pelagic fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Indonesian snapper, Octopus and blue swimming crab fisheries in Philippines.\nThe project is an inter-regional intervention. Market engagement and knowledge management are global components. The sustainable marine commodities platforms and FIPs will be implemented, using a participatory approach in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines.","expected_outputs":"Increased capacities

The project aims to enhance production competitiveness of small and mid-sized farmers by establishing greenhouse technology for high value added agro-products, and increase farmers income by enhancing distribution channel in related to co-branding and local shipping in the Philippines.   The Korean Smart Farm Greenhouses offers the Philippine agriculture a possible solution to the country's climate change concern being experienced by our highland vegetable growers. It would be also a showcase for Good Agricultural Practice, addressing the food safety requirements in the Food Safety Law in the country.   The piloting of the Korean Style Greenhouse is also an avenue to get the advance climate proof greenhouse technology which can be utilized in organic crop production, and eventually gain an easy access to Korean market to boost Philippine agriculture. Aside from the productivity, the established operating software  will provide greenhouse environment information to farmers by mobile to help them manage operating risk. Also, the environmental and production data collected through the software will guide to establish environmental control system optimized in the local environment of the Philippines.","expected_outputs":"Smart Greenhouse constructed and  operating system established","spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"0","pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries"},"pdp_chapters":[],"no_pdp_indicator":false,"pdp_indicators":[],"gad_id":null,"gad":{"id":null,"name":null},"target_start_year":"2018","target_end_year":"2021","preparation_document":{"id":null,"name":null},"has_fs":false,"feasibility_study":{"id":60,"needs_assistance":false,"fs_status_id":null,"fs_status":null,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0},"has_row":false,"right_of_way":{"id":59,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"has_rap":false,"resettlement_action_plan":{"id":59,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"employment_generated":"0","funding_source_id":null,"funding_source":{"id":null,"name":null},"funding_sources":[],"implementation_mode_id":"75","implementation_mode":{"id":75,"name":"Through ODA pursuant to RA 8182 or the ODA Act of 1996"},"other_fs":null,"project_status_id":"1","project_status":{"id":1,"name":"Ongoing"},"updates":"Ongoing.

It is necessary with the existing conditions of the NSQCS Seed Testing laboratories to be subject for renovation and improvement and others for establishment especially for those that will be relocated or transferred just like in the case of Regions 13 nd 8. Also, the renovation and establishment of seed laboratories is deemed necessary to properly place and install the laboratory equipment for Seed Health and Biotechnology Units to guarantee its maximum use and performance. Hence, the proposal for the establishment and rehabilitation of BPI-NSQCS Seed Testing laboratories are crucial for the efficient delivery of seed testing and seed certification in proving quality service to our stakeholders and clientele.\n\nThe BPI-NSQCS is mandated to provide quality assurance and control services to assure availability of high quality seeds and improved planting materials

RMS will be used for identification of insect\r\npests intercepted during routine inspection. Initial\r\nidentification will be carried out by PQ officers and\r\nthrough the aid of remote imaging system, local and\r\ninternational entomology experts will be\r\ntapped\/engaged to confirm initial identification or to\r\nprovide technical assistance for a more reliable and\r\naccurate identification of the specimen. This may be\r\ndone real time or through use of software to capture\r\nand store the information. This technology is vital for\r\nbiosecurity purposes in terms of the applicable\r\nmanagement and containment of biosecurity risks\r\nassociated with the incoming plant commodities.\r\nB. Capacity Building of PQ officers on the Use of\r\nRemote Microscopy System and Identification of\r\nInsect Pest\r\nTwo (2) participants from each identified six (6) Plant\r\nQuarantine Stations and Plant Quarantine Officers from\r\nthe Central Office and Post Entry Quarantine Station, a\r\ntotal of (20) PQ personnel, will be trained for Remote\r\nMicroscopy System and Insect Pest Identification. The\r\ntraining will be conducted in Manila with experts\r\ncoming from Korea and PH Plant Quarantine personnel\r\ntrained in Korea, will serve as trainors.

Second day onwards\r\nwill be utilized on insect pest identification depending\r\non the program which Korean experts will provide. This\r\nis applicable to the initial training that would be\r\nconducted. The three (3) succeeding trainings would\r\ndepend on the insect groups that will be identified later.\r\nSame number of participants would attend the said\r\ntrainings.\r\nGeneral Objective:\r\n1. To strengthen the capability of the National Plant\r\nQuarantine Services Division (NPQSD) on efficient\r\napproach for insect pest identification\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n1. To equip six (6) NPQSD stations with remote\r\nmicroscopy system for monitoring and\r\nidentification of insect pests of regulatory\r\nsignificance.\r\n2. To enhance capacity and increase capability of 20\r\nPQ personnel on the identification of insect pest of\r\nregulatory significance.","expected_outputs":"A rapid and cost-effective method in the

Increase income of farmer beneficiaries through the establishment of Solar-Powered Fertigation Systems (SPFS);\r\nb. Increase productivity of rainfed areas and shallow tube well (STW)-serviced production areas;\r\nc.

This could affect the replacements of components that needs repair. Replacement and\/or hiring of competent operators may also be needed. \n\nNatural Disaster - It is difficult to predict natural hazards especially earthquakes that may affect the areas where the SPFS are installed. Natural hazards likely disrupt the operation of SPFS. \t\n\n\nMitigation Strategies:\n\nOperator Error -Operators are required to have the skill and experience to operate a SPFS and are regularly trained and refreshed on the operational procedure of the different components. They should also be monitored regularly by the third-party auditor.\n\nLack of competent manpower - Training should be done for prospective inexperienced operators. They can be trained in expert organizations\/institutes. SPFS can also be designed to use lower operator requirements as an alternative. \n\nLack of operating budget - Management should come up with a budget plan that coincides with the operation plan and provides enough resources for contingencies. \n\nNatural disaster - The design of the SPFS should be able to withstand the impact of natural hazards in order to minimize the disaster impacts. A disaster management plan should be in place in order for the operation to bounce back as soon as possible.","pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic

information, education and communication support services for farmers\u2019 groups and agricultural technicians of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and training services are among those banner programs of PhilFIDA. Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and\/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. \r\n\r\nData and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nVoice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nThe ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals. This also includes the proposed ICT organizational structure to cope with changing requirements and fast-paced technology.\r\n\r\nThis ISSP covers the Central Office, Laboratories, Experimental Stations and all Regional and Provincial Offices of PhilFIDA.","expected_outputs":"Procured ICT hardwares and software to computerize the operation of

in line with the Republic Act 7900 (High Value Crops Development Act of 1995). This is an act to promote the production, processing, marketing and distribution of high value crops. HVCDP is a priority program of the Department of Agriculture created to help address food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth through increased farm income and productivity. The target service areas include convergence areas, strategic production zones and farm households. These areas need the interventions from the government in terms of production, extension, processing, marketing and regulatory support. The program is implemented yearly with a coverage of implementation down to barangay levels. The budgetary allocation for the implementation of PAP for the HVCDP is taken from the GAA with a cost sharing arrangement scheme. A specific guidelines in the PAPs implementation is being followed  by the DA RFUs together with partner implementers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \nComponents of the Program include:\n i.

Depending on the crops and farm management techniques employed by the farmers, increase in income would vary from PhP 30,000 to as much as PhP 100,000 per hectare. The choice of crops will depend on the result of the Rapid Marketing Appraisal (RMA) that the community especially the farmers would undertake with the assistance of the PCA Community

Program (DHIP) is sometimes referred to as DHI, DHIA, or DHIR specifically for large animals. This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd\u2019s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.\n\nIn addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.\n\nThe project is expected to benefit some 150,000 dairy farmers and 200 organized groups.","expected_outputs":"a.

livestock farmers, in particular, and the farming sector, in general, productive and profitable through sound policies, programs, research and services on animal production, post-harvest, health and welfare. The BAI is mandated to implement programs for the development and expansion of livestock and poultry to meet the requirements of the growing populace and to make the local produce competitiveness in the global market. \n\nThe BAI has six (6) Research and Development Centers (RDCs) situated in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao which serve not only as centers for research and development concerning animal genetic improvement, but also as breeding facilities for preservation, conservation, and utilization of genetic materials. Each RDC cater specific commodity given the following names:\n\n\u2022\tNational Swine and Poultry Research and Development Center- Tiaong, Quezon\n\u2022\tNational Beef Cattle Research and Development Centers- Busuanga, Palawan; General Tinio, Nuevba Ecija; and Malaybala, Bukidnon)\n\u2022\tNational Small Ruminant Research and Development Center- Milagros, Masbate\n\u2022\tNational Feed Resource Research and Development Center- Bagalupa, Zamboanga Del Sur\n\nAlthough these RDCs are able to cater nationwide, there is a need for establishment of stock farm near urban areas which serve the purpose of availing to farmers\u2019 quality breeding stocks at affordable prices. With the country\u2019s cities growing rapidly, farming in and around urban areas play a bigger role in feeding city populations. \nGiven this situation, this necessitates the activation of BAI Tanay Stock Farm. The Tanay Stock Farm is the nearest location for any aspiring livestock and poultry farmers. The project aims at addressing the following constraints in the surrounding urban areas:\n1. Low Livestock Productivity\n2. Inadequate feed resources \n3. Inadequate skills and knowledge by the breeding workforce\n\nThe project seeks to establish Tanay Stock Farm as a center for breeding cattle, poultry, swine, and small ruminants, for the purpose of preservation, conservation, and utilization of genetic materials. This will also serve as a source of quality feed resources.  The tanay stock farm will support the surrounding communities with quality livestock breeds for all livestock and poultry commodities as well as build their capacity on animal production and farm management practices for sustainable and pro\ufb01table livestock enterprises. \nThe achievement of these will contribute to the overall sector objective which is food security.","expected_outputs":"Established Tanay Stock

animal health workers is equally important as providing quality animal health services to the public. One of the major challenges in providing quality public veterinary services is lack of infrastructures which serve as a venue to capacitate their knowledge and skills. An improved learning environment links to effective performance of our animal health workers. Lack of quality animal health services has a great impact on other economically important diseases that may cause heavy losses to livestock producers. Addressing diseases of public health importance effectively contribute to better health outcomes among communities and directly links to food safety. \n\nGuided with the main thrust of promoting animal health and welfare and strengthening regulatory services in the country, the establishment of Baguio Office Veterinary and Regulatory Development Centre, that will serve as a training centre to capacitate the knowledge and skills of our animal health workers on the proper protocol during animal health emergencies. Moreover, this will also serve as a training centre for regulatory activities among animal health workers at the Local Government Unit (LGU)\n\nProvide a training centre for the animal health workers

industry in the highly swine dense provinces in Regions III and IVA, spread to nearby regions in North and South of Luzon, with an incursion in Region XI. The outbreak that started in Rizal, Bulacan and now in some parts of Luzon and Mindanao area continue to pose significant threat to the swine industry. To date a total of 250,000 hogs have been killed to abate the spread of the disease. There is no effective vaccine or treatment and outbreaks can be devastating with the most virulent forms and can be lethal in 100% of infected animals.\n\nWith the ongoing disease situation, there is a need to augment and strengthen government capacity in disease monitoring and surveillance, quick response and disease control, laboratory testing, veterinary quarantine, information, education and communication of stakeholders for African Swine Fever. \n\nThis progamme will be implemented with the development and execution of a National ASF Prevention and Control Programme with the following components: \n\n1) Public Awareness\n2) Disease Monitoring and Surveillance, and \n3) Border Control and Movement Management. \n\nThe programme also aims to support and guide Regional, Provincial and Local Government Unit counterparts by providing necessary technical support to overall efforts in respective localities, as well as operational and logistic support to local veterinary offices.\n\nThere is also a great need to further enhance and equip the national and more so the 15 Regional Animal Disease Laboratories\u2019 (RADDLs\u2019) diagnostic capabilities for early disease detection and thereby preventing the occurrence or rapid spread in the country.\n\nIndirectly, the ASF testing services will be made available in the regions for the producers\/raisers to submit samples for assay. Samples need not be sent to the ADDRL for testing. This way, results can be had the shortest possible time so that control measures be implemented outright. This strategy will aide in controlling the spread of the virus rather than waiting for the results and letting the virus spread further. In controlling the spread, the farmers can still save their animals and have them sold rather than having the pigs indemnified.\nThis project aims to enhance activities on disease monitoring and surveillance, quick response and disease control, veterinary quarantine, information, education and communication of stakeholders for African Swine Fever through the implementation of a National ASF Prevention and Control Programme.\n\nTo equip the 15 Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories (RADDLs) and ADDRL (National Lab) in ASF disease diagnosis through training of diagnosticians on basic and advance PCR testing procedures, provision of new equipment, sufficient supplies and materials for early and rapid detection of the disease.","expected_outputs":"Strengthening Veterinary

through Animal Facilities Regulations Section of the Animal Health and Welfare Division, is mandated by different laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act and the Food Safety Act, to register and inspect animal facilities before operation. This is to ensure animal welfare, disease prevention and control, among others. Currently, the AHWD has four different inspection systems for animal facilities, and has only registered approximately 3,000 animal facilities nationwide.\n\nThe need to identify, register, and map animal facilities is ever growing, especially with the advent of disease outbreaks such as the Avian Influenza outbreak in 2017 and the African Swine Fever outbreak in 2019. There is also a growing clamor from the animal industry stakeholders for real time data in the number of animal facilities nationwide as well as increasing effort from the government to create database and systems for storage of these data to support creation of legislations.\n\nThis project will seek to identify, register and map animal facilities in Region III and Region IVA, which are considered as areas with dense farms, as well as Region NCR which contains many clinics and hospitals.\n\nThe project will therefore gather these data to be the baseline data for future projects and programs of the Bureau.\n\nThis proposal aims for the following:\n\u2022\tTo survey animal facilities in Region III, Region IVA and NCR in collaboration with the different LGUs and DA Regional Field Offices;\n\u2022\tTo gather and create a baseline database of animal facilities in the selected regions that will be uploaded to the PhilAHIS system; and\n\u2022\tTo present a draft population map that could be used by decision makers as well as basis for future projects and programs of the Bureau.","expected_outputs":"Registration of Animal

different inspection systems for farms: the Animal Facility Registration as required under the Republic Act 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act, wherein all facilities are required to be registered; the Farm Accreditation as a requirement for transport, wherein all farms that would be transporting animals should be required a farm inspection and sample collection of animals to know the disease status of the farm and to facilitate safe transport of animals from one region to another; the Good Animal Husbandry Practices Certification Program, wherein farms are certified if they are in compliance with Food Safety Standards as required by the Department of Agriculture and therefore farms produces safe and quality food products; and the Breeder Farm accreditation, wherein farms are ensured to produce healthy and quality breeder animals.\n\nThe current system has become burdensome not only for farmers but for implementers as it requires multiple farm visits that presents biosecurity risks and loss of time for inspectors. Also, the different inspection systems have overlapping and redundant requirements. The procedure for application is also burdensome for the applicants which require multiple visits to the implementers\u2019 office. Database of the Bureau is also inadequate in the delivering of up to date data for the proper implementation of regulatory functions and services to the animal industry.\n\nThis proposal consists of three solutions to address the current problem of the Bureau:\n\u2022\tHarmonization of the different regulatory systems for farms of the Bureau of Animal Industry;\n\u2022\tCreation of the farm online registration system; \n\u2022\tUse of technological solutions (i.e. cameras, radio, computers) for the ease of registration and inspection of farms;\nThis proposal aims for the following:\n\u2022\tTo better facilitate the regulation of farms in the country with streamlined and harmonized requirements;\n\u2022\tTo comply with the provisions of the Republic Act 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018;\n\u2022\tTo adapt the ISO\/IEC 17020 or the \u201cGeneral Criteria for the Operation of Various Type of Bodies Performing

hemorrhagic disease in susceptible species of the Suidae family, including domestic pigs and wild boar. Currently, there is no effective vaccine to protect swine from this disease and in its more virulent form can kill 100% of affected pigs. The ASF virus is very resistant and can survive long periods in very cold and very hot weather, and even in dried or cured pork products or carcasses. The threat of incursion of ASF into Asia has been a major concern as the region is the major pig production area with China alone being home to more than half the global population of swine. On 3rd August 2018, the first detection of ASF was reported from a pig farm in China. Until now, ASF has been subsequently reported in Mongolia, Viet Nam and Cambodia respectively. The high concentration of large-scale pig production farms, with associated value chains out of these high swine density areas, implies that the risk of spread within the country and into the region remains high, if the disease is not contained. Swine and swine product value chains are extensive with many connections at regional level for the purpose of commerce in meat and breeding. The potential further spread of ASF into other Southeast Asian countries now represents an imminent threat for the pig population in this region affecting pig and pork price, pig value chain and finally food security, particularly the populations with lower incomes. This project is specifically aimed to strengthen and activate the countries\u2019 preparedness including risk-based prevention and reduction as well as emergency response measures immediately to address the threat of ASF spreading to other parts of Southeast Asia. The project also aims to pilot a community-based approach to support smallholders to face risks and minimize impacts of ASF in an endemic situation\n\nProject Components:\n1. Better understanding of ASF \n2. Enhanced risk-based approach for ASF prevention and control \n3. Communication and advocacy \n4. Capacity building \n5.

  \nOutput 1: Risk based information is available and utilized for strategic planning;  \nOutput 2: Capacities for early detection of ASF is strengthened and applied using risk-based strategies; \nOutput 3: Capacities for field emergency response of ASF is strengthened and applied at all levels; \nOutput 4: Information, education and communication (IECs) materials on ASF are available to

Objective\n\nThis project aims to improvethe country\u2019s capacity to control and prevent occurrence of animal diseases.\n\nSpecificObjectives\n\t\nThe specific objectives of the project are the following:\n1.\tTo create and improve databases of the animal industry of the Philippines;\n2.\tTo upgrade animal related registrations and permitting into online systems; \n3.\tTo integrate data from different databases that will provide valuable information to decision makers and stakeholders;\n4.\tTo create enabling policies in the use of the PhilAHIS; and\n5.\tTo advancethe capability of the Philippine government on animal disease prevention, forecast, quarantine, control and post management.\n\nC.\tMajor Components and Strategies\n\n1.\tImprovement of the PhilAHIS Data Center infrastructure and equipment\n\nThecurrent data warehousing facility of PhilAHIS has adequate functional capacity at this point to run the current version of the system. The proposed upgrade of the system, however, would need further improvement and modernization of thePhilAHIS Data Center\u2019s infrastructure and equipment. This should increase its capacity in order to house all the information that will be gathered from the project collaborators, counterparts and end-users, and to accommodate data management and traceability objectives of the proposed project. \n\nThe strategies proposed for this component are as follows:\n\u2022\tConstruction of an extension and renovation of the existing PhilAHIS building inside the BAI compound that will serve as the modernized Animal Data Center of the PhilAHIS. The facility shall include:\no\tServer rooms with adequate servers installed to run the upgraded PhilAHIS;\no\tExpanded office, living and storage space that will accommodate PhilAHIS staff and its additional functions; and\no\tImproved centralized command center for emergency animal disease responses.\n\u2022\tProcurement of adequate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and software and other related Information Technology (IT) components; and\n\u2022\tRecruitment and hiring of technical and IT personnel.\n\n2.\tSystem development and enhancement of PhilAHIS\n\nThe project aims to upgrade the current PhilAHIS to be a developed and integrated information system for all animal related data in the Philippines. This is envisioned to result in the significant improvement the veterinary services in the country. It will also elevate quality of industry reporting and government services of the DA and its livestock agencies. The creation of databases, information systems, applications and other technological solutions are proposed to achieve this aim.A technical working group (TWG) will be established that will guide the project proponents in the concept design and development of the information systems.\n\nThe name PhilAHIS will be retained for branding purposes, as this name has been known locally to all partner agencies and LGUs, including international partners such as OIE and the Food And Agriculture Organization(FAO) because of its use during the eradication program of FMD. This brand is also known to other ASEAN Member States (AMS).\n\nThe development of the PhilAHIS will contain the following strategies:\n\u2022\tCreation ofdatabasesand development of online systems in several regulations of the Animal Industry\no\tDevelopment of an online registration and application system of all animal facilities (e.g. farms), local animal transport vehicles, animal traders, meat establishments, meat transport vehicles and feed, drugs and biologics establishment;\no\tImprovement, design enhancement and upgrading of system features of the local shipping permit issuance system and the certificate of meat inspection issuance system; and\no\tIntegration of all databases into a monitoring system of animal population, and movement of animals, animal products and by-products.\n\u2022\tUpgrading of Disease Control and Surveillance information systems\no\tExpansion and modification of the existing PhilAHIS Field Monitoring System (desktop and web application) that records services of LGU personnel to farmers;\no\tCreation of an online animal disease reporting system through a web and mobile application for farmers, animal health workers, veterinarians, etc. that will facilitate ease of reporting and that will follow specific guidelines and protocols (e.g. all reports to be furnished to the BAI, DA Regional Field Offices (DA-RFO) and LGU);\no\tDevelopment of a Surveillance and Vaccination usage system that will incorporate all epidemiologic surveillance services of different animal health programs of the government; and\no\tInception of the Laboratory Information System that will provide results for all testing need doneby the government.\n\u2022\tImprovement of Disease Response and Resolution capabilities of the government\nImprovement of the PhilAHIS system that shall integrate data from baseline databases and results from disease control and surveillance to:\no\tAllow forecasting and risk analysis of disease outbreak;\no\tEnable use of data analysis and data visualizations such as charts and maps;\no\tAllow immediate communication from decision makers to ground personnel for disease response and quarantine measures; and\no\tAllow real time notice to livestock industry of outbreaks through technical bulletins passed thru different mediums.\n\u2022\tExpand and link PhilAHIS to other existing livestock information system from NMIS, PCC and NDA.\n\u2022\tMirroring of data to the DA ICTS Data Center\n\n\n3.\tSystem Deployment\n\nThe development of the upgraded PhilAHIS will be in close coordination with the TWG. Upon drafting the final system, the PhilAHIS team and the TWG shall conduct the pilot testing of the upgrade PhilAHIS with the following respective order:\na.\tBAI and NMIS Central Offices;\nb.\tSelected DARFOs, PCC and NDA; and\nc.\tSelected PVOs, MVOs and CVOs.\n\nOnce pilot testing conducted is successful, and upon the approval and support of the steering committee, the team will move to deploy the system to the end users in geographical clusters with the following respective order:\na.\tNorth Luzon Cluster;\nb.\tSouth Luzon Cluster;\nc.\tVisayas Cluster; and\nd.\tMindanao Cluster\n\nIn a geographical cluster, the team will deploy the system and install all necessary equipment to all end users within the cluster, such as BAI \u2013 Veterinary Quarantine Offices, NMIS Regional Offices, DARFOs, and PVOs. The cluster deployment is strategized so as to minimize financial costs and time spent. A skeletal team will remain in the data center so as to resolve any issues relating to system deployment. After deployment, the team will conduct quarterly or biannual assessment, as determined necessary, of the success of the deployment and of the system.\n\n4.\tPolicy and Legislation Formulation\n\nThe data collection and utility of the proposed PhilAHIS improvement will not be only for the BAI but with the different stakeholders of the livestock industry such as national government offices such as the DA and its attached agencies (e.g. NMIS, PCC, NDA, DA RFO), LGU (e.g. Provincial, City and Municipal Veterinary Offices), academe, and the private sector. Formulation of policies in support of the system will be created with strategies as follows:\n\u2022\tCreation of a steering committee that will spearhead the implementation of the project;\n\u2022\tReview of existing policies and legislations on the collection of data for the system;\n\u2022\tCreation of policies and legislations to strengthen the use of PhilAHIS such as the assigning of rules and responsibilities on data collection to different government agencies and creation of respective technical working groups; and\n\u2022\tConsultation, and awareness campaign with different stakeholders that will utilize the system.\n\n5.\tCapacity Building\n\nThe programming team of the project will be sent to Korea through this project in order to be trained on the best practices in the implementation of KAHIS for several months. This will be vital in the enhancement and expansion of the system in the Philippines through the PhilAHIS.\n\nTechnical Veterinary team from the BAI and from collaborating agencies will be trained on disease prevention, forecast, quarantine, control and post-management in order to fully understand the KAHIS and to guide in the creation of the PhilAHIS.\n\nThe animal industry stakeholders such as LGUs and the possible users of the system will be trained in the use of the system in order to fully input correct data into the database and to fully utilize the system in their respective areas of jurisdiction.","expected_outputs":"At the end of the 5 year-engagement of the project,the following are expected to have been accomplished:\n1.\tTrained programming team and technical veterinary team on the creation and utilization of the PhilAHIS system;\n2.\tAdequately improved and upgraded PhilAHIS data center infrastructure, facilities and equipment to run the system;\n3.\tFunctional information system and online registration system for animal facilities, animal transport vehicles, animal traders, meat establishments and meat transport vehicles, animal feeds, drugs and biologics

backyard raisers which accounts for 3,716.350 or 98.68% of the total population.  The Ilocos Region is the top one producer of goats by backyard raisers which accounts for the 11.83 percent of the total goat inventory produced by backyard raisers (PSA, 2017). With this information, it is therefore proper to assist our backyard raisers in the control of diseases that may affect their animals. Although the prevalence rate of CAEV in Region 1, as per result of the just concluded surveillance research is quite low 2.6% or 13 out of 500 blood samples, this is a cause for alarm.  Since CAEV is a lingering viral disease transmitted through the milk, immediate diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and control is very essential. \n\nIt is therefore the immediate goal of this project to identify, eradicate and control not only CAEV but also other emerging and re-emerging diseases that threaten the well-being of the animal industry.  The project will also hone the skills of future veterinarians in laboratory diagnosis, disease monitoring and control. Furthermore the project will provide prompt diagnosis, eradication, treatment and control of animal diseases ultimately improving the status of the livestock industry in the region. \n\n1.\tTo provide reliable and timely results for CAE and other animal disease diagnostic services;\n2.\tTo provide proper monitoring  of CAE, emerging and re-emerging diseases and spread of diseases that threaten the profitability and marketability of livestock in the region;\n3.\tTo provide disease surveillance  information to livestock producers and companion animals so that prompt control measures can be immediately instituted to prevent spread of animal diseases;\n4.\tTo provide educational hands-on practice for future veterinarians on disease diagnosis;  and\n5.\tTo improve the performance and capability of the graduates of the College of Veterinary Medicine of DMMMSU.","expected_outputs":"1.\tTo provide reliable and timely results for CAE and other animal disease diagnostic services;\n2.\tTo provide proper monitoring  of CAE, emerging and re-emerging diseases and spread of diseases that threaten the profitability and marketability of livestock in the region;\n3.\tTo provide disease surveillance  information to livestock producers and companion animals so that prompt control measures can be immediately instituted to prevent spread of animal diseases;\n4.\tTo provide educational hands-on practice for future veterinarians on disease diagnosis;  and\n5.\tTo improve the performance and capability of the graduates of the College of Veterinary Medicine of DMMMSU.","spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government Building"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Implementation Risk: Problems of the availability of funds to support the project.\nMitigation Strategy: Outsourcing of other funding agency.","pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries"},"pdp_chapters":[],"no_pdp_indicator":false,"pdp_indicators":[{"id":8221,"name":"Share of AFF research and development (R&D) government budget to total AFF GVA increased (%, cumulative)","children":[]},{"id":8222,"name":"Number of new technologies increased","children":[]},{"id":8223,"name":"Number of beneficiaries provided with extension services increased","children":[]}],"gad_id":null,"gad":{"id":null,"name":null},"target_start_year":"2022","target_end_year":"2023","preparation_document":{"id":3,"name":"Project Proposal"},"has_fs":false,"feasibility_study":{"id":276,"needs_assistance":false,"fs_status_id":null,"fs_status":null,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0},"has_row":false,"right_of_way":{"id":273,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"has_rap":false,"resettlement_action_plan":{"id":273,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"employment_generated":null,"funding_source_id":"1","funding_source":{"id":1,"name":"NG-Local"},"funding_sources":[],"implementation_mode_id":"74","implementation_mode":{"id":74,"name":"Through Local Funds in accordance with RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Act"},"other_fs":null,"project_status_id":"2","project_status":{"id":2,"name":"Proposed"},"updates":"With Concept Note.

laboratory biosafety and biosecurity identified during laboratory assessments (i.e.FAO-Laboratory Mapping Tool and OIE-PVS Evaluation)conducted by laboratory experts from international agencies. As product of trainings and assessments, there were recommendations that are critical in the implementation of biosafety and biosecurity in the national laboratories. In this project, the laboratories of the Veterinary Laboratory Division (VLD) premises and facilities will beimproved to mitigate the potential threat of intentional or unintentional introduction of pathogenic microorganisms and other hazardous implements to the environment, to the individuals working and availing the diagnostic services offered by the laboratories. \n\nThe VLD is compose of five (5) laboratories; the Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Lab. (ADDRL), the Veterinary Biologics Assay Lab. (VBAL), the Veterinary Biologics Production Lab. (VBPL), the Chemical Feed Analysis Lab. (CFAL) and the Veterinary DrugProduction and Assay Lab. (VDPAL).\n\nThe ADDRL is the national laboratory for animal disease diagnosis that serves as the model for the facilities in promotion and practice of biosafety to other laboratories complying to prescribed safety level standards. One that is acceptable with international counterparts with similar responsibilities that may translate to increased trust and confidence from its stakeholders.\n\nThe VBAL, VBPL, CFAL and VDPAL are the laboratories responsible for the quality testing of imported\/locally-produced vet. biologics, vet. biologics production, feed analysis and vet. drug production\/assay respectively.\n\nAt present, the laboratories have their own disposal processes that are not within the acceptable standards but are likewise amenable. There is no designated area for the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) which is mandated by law. There is only one crematorium donated by USDTRA still for repair but spare parts unavailable. \n\nChemical wastes are neutralized and are poured into empty bottles and allowed to decay for sometime prior to disposal in the sewage. Howerver, for chemicals that cannot be neutralized are decanted in bottles and are placed in isolated areas prior to disposal by a third-party waste management service. \n\nAmong the activities covered in this project are the installation of the liquid waste treatment, composting facilities for solid wastes and CCTV, procurement of laboratory storage cabinets, thermal and sterilization equipment and repair of various laboratory-associated fixtures. \n\nThe laboratories are a probable source of disease-causing organisms that can harm the laboratory staff, clients, the whole community and livestock industries. The risk of intentional or unintentional release of infectious microorganisms to the environment are very high. Hazardous chemicals can also be released to the environment if not treated.  It is the aim of this project to improve the laboratories\u2019 capacity to mitigate or eliminate risks associated to laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.  \n\nWithin the year\u2019s implementation, it hopes to secure the laboratories and protect our livestock industry and the general public from possible harm of contracting infectious diseases or inhalation of hazardous chemicals. With the facilities to be installed and measures implemented, the risks shall be minimized and assurance of a safe workplace is achieved. The measures adapted will be evidenced by less absences, less incidents of sickness among workers and most importantly safety practices within the laboratory workplaces is achieved.","expected_outputs":"Modernized BAI Laboratories","spatial_coverage_id":"1","spatial_coverage":{"id":1,"name":"Nationwide"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government Building"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Implementation Risk: Problems of the availability of funds to support the project.\nMitigation Strategy: Outsourcing of other funding agency.","pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries"},"pdp_chapters":[],"no_pdp_indicator":false,"pdp_indicators":[{"id":8221,"name":"Share of AFF research and development (R&D) government budget to total AFF GVA increased (%, cumulative)","children":[]},{"id":8222,"name":"Number of new technologies increased","children":[]},{"id":8223,"name":"Number of beneficiaries provided with extension services increased","children":[]}],"gad_id":null,"gad":{"id":null,"name":null},"target_start_year":"2022","target_end_year":"2022","preparation_document":{"id":4,"name":"Concept Note"},"has_fs":false,"feasibility_study":{"id":278,"needs_assistance":false,"fs_status_id":null,"fs_status":null,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0},"has_row":false,"right_of_way":{"id":275,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"has_rap":false,"resettlement_action_plan":{"id":275,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"employment_generated":null,"funding_source_id":"1","funding_source":{"id":1,"name":"NG-Local"},"funding_sources":[],"implementation_mode_id":"74","implementation_mode":{"id":74,"name":"Through Local Funds in accordance with RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Act"},"other_fs":null,"project_status_id":"2","project_status":{"id":2,"name":"Proposed"},"updates":"With project Proposal.

It is defined in RA 1556 as embracing all such articles to be used as feeds purporting to supply protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, antibiotics, growth promoting factors whether identified or unidentified and\/or correcting nutritional disorders. The AFVDBCD is the office in-charge in regulating feeds, feed products as well as veterinary drugs and biologicals. In order to cope with the assigned task the DA deputized officer in the Regions to assist in the implementation. But the constant turn-over of deputized personnel due to promotion, transfers, retirement, etc. handicapped the implementation of feed regulations. The deputized personnel have their own targets and functions within the Region and most of times they are multitasking. During emergencies like disease outbreaks they are called on to assist thereby the implementation of feed laws is left behind.\n\nThe delays in the issuance of licenses and registrations are a major consideration. Lack, incomplete or incorrect requirements\/attachments to the applications will not be processed; The application will be returned to the applicant for compliance and this cause the delay especially if the applicant is from the Regions. Under the Food Safety Act, the BAI is mandated to ensure food safety at the primary production and the function of ensuring feed safety rests in this office. With the ASF or any animal disease outbreak where transmission is through feeds preventive measures has to be implemented.

It will take-off from the gains and lessons of various DA programs such as project tracking by geo-tagging and building capacity of LGUs and farming and fishing communities to manage and sustain agri-fishery support infrastructure and services, among others.\r\nThe Project will operationalize the national and regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (AFMPs) through integration of plans at the provincial level. Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.\r\n\r\nThe Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.\r\n\r\nLocal Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Development: this component aims to engage broad sections of the sector in the production of marketable surplus through investments in strategic segments of priority commodity value chains and strengthening collaboration between DA and the Local Government Units.

Isabela","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":"One of the strategies to promote local production of semen straws is the Establishment of the National Dairy Cattle Breeding and Artificial Insemination Center (NDCBAIC) in Isabela State University (ISU), Echague, Isabela. The Philippines has seen the effectiveness of such facility through the Bureau of Animal Industry\u2019s National Artificial Breeding Center (BAI-NABC) located in Bukidnon. Since BAI NABC prioritizes in processing semen for beef production, it would be plausible to establish a center dedicated to dairy cattle. This proposal aims to replicate the success of the Bukidnon breeding center in Northern Luzon. This is in anticipation of the growing dairy industry in the country and the infusion of more dairy stocks. The establishment of NDCBAIC in ISU in Echangue, Isabela will be one of the breakthroughs in the strengthening of the implementation of the NDA\u2019s breeding and upgrading programs in Luzon. \n\nThe cost to locally produce one straw of regular semen is cheaper at about P83.00 as compared to the cost of imported semen straws at about P750.00. At twice a week collection, the center will be able to produce some 49,920 semen straws annually costing about P4.14 million as compared to importing the same number which will amount to P37.44 million. \nISU is a very suitable host for the project since it has the following:\n\u2022 Existing Administration Building\n\u2022 Existing Bull Shed\n\u2022 Pasture\/Forage Development Area\n\u2022 Showroom of Technologies and Products\n\u2022 Training and IEC Center\n\nAs the project will also serve as a training center for its undergraduate and graduate agricultural and veterinary students including dairy farmers, ISU will not only vital in breeding dairy animals but also in \u201cbreeding\u201d the next generations of dairy technicians, dairy veterinarians and dairy farmers. \n\nHaving the project in ISU, NDA will strongly supports the bid of Echague LGU to become the Science and Ecological City of the North by 20222. Not far from the future, Echague could also be North Luzon\u2019s Dairy City (Dairy Hub). NDCBAIC will surely enhance and enrich ISU\u2019s mandates and functions along with its instruction, research, development, production and resources generation.\n \nOverall, the project is necessary to strengthen nation\u2019s war against malnutrition and poverty mitigation by creating more livelihood and opportunities through modern dairy agriculture. The project will be instrumental in increasing the national milk output by 24% and growing the Philippines Dairy Cattle Herd by 31% while training 200 undergraduate and graduate agricultural and veterinary students and serving 2,056 dairy farmers annually.","expected_outputs":"Annually, NDCBAIC will have the following deliverables:  \n1.\tProduced 49,920 semen straws \n2.\tServed 13,440 animals at 1.5 straws per cow;\n3.\tProduced 8,300 calves in which 4,000 are potential dairy heifers;\n4.\tIncreased the national milk output by 5.7 million liters of milk;\n5.\tBenefited 2,056 dairy farmers with animal holdings.\n6.\tTrained 200 undergraduate and graduate agricultural and veterinary students annually.","spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[{"id":63,"name":"Government Building"}],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Implementation Risk as follows:\n1.

Thus, measurement of abovementioned losses has to be updated and estimate new figures for other crops that will serve as baseline.   \r\n\r\nAs a commitment to the PDP 2017-2022 per agreement during the Mid-term Updating, PHilMech is expected to update and determine the magnitude of postharvest losses of selected fruits and vegetables on a regular basis which starts 2020 onwards.","expected_outputs":"updated\/established postharvest losses for selected fruits and vegetables","spatial_coverage_id":"2","spatial_coverage":{"id":2,"name":"Interregional"},"regions":[{"id":1,"name":"Ilocos Region"},{"id":2,"name":"Cagayan Valley"},{"id":3,"name":"Central Luzon"},{"id":5,"name":"Bicol Region"},{"id":6,"name":"Western Visayas"},{"id":7,"name":"Central Visayas"},{"id":8,"name":"Eastern Visayas"},{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga Peninsula"},{"id":10,"name":"Norther Mindanao"},{"id":11,"name":"Davao Region"},{"id":12,"name":"SOCCSKSARGEN"},{"id":13,"name":"CARAGA"},{"id":14,"name":"Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao"},{"id":15,"name":"Cordillera Administrative Region"},{"id":40,"name":"CALABARZON"},{"id":41,"name":"MIMAROPA"}],"pip":false,"pip_typology":null,"research":false,"cip":null,"ifp":null,"cip_type":null,"iccable":false,"approval_level_id":null,"approval_level":{"id":null,"name":null},"approval_date":"","trip":null,"rdip":false,"rdc_endorsement_required":"0","rdc_endorsed":false,"rdc_endorsed_date":"","infrastructure_subsectors":[],"other_infrastructure":null,"risk":"Project implementers may face the risk of uncooperative cooperators and low accuracy of data if collaborators or enumerators are not guided properly","pdp_chapter_id":"8","pdp_chapter":{"id":8,"name":"Chapter 08: Expanding Economic Opportunities in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries"},"pdp_chapters":[{"id":99,"name":"No Chapter"}],"no_pdp_indicator":false,"pdp_indicators":[{"id":8111,"name":"Program area for perennial crops provided with technical support services increased (ha) (Mango, Coffee, Cacao,Rubber, Banana","children":[]}],"gad_id":null,"gad":{"id":null,"name":null},"target_start_year":"2021","target_end_year":"2022","preparation_document":{"id":4,"name":"Concept Note"},"has_fs":false,"feasibility_study":{"id":308,"needs_assistance":false,"fs_status_id":null,"fs_status":null,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0},"has_row":false,"right_of_way":{"id":303,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"has_rap":false,"resettlement_action_plan":{"id":303,"y2016":0,"y2017":0,"y2018":0,"y2019":0,"y2020":0,"y2021":0,"y2022":0,"y2023":0,"y2024":0,"y2025":0,"total":0,"affected_households":null},"employment_generated":"10","funding_source_id":"1","funding_source":{"id":1,"name":"NG-Local"},"funding_sources":[{"id":1,"name":"NG-Local"}],"implementation_mode_id":"74","implementation_mode":{"id":74,"name":"Through Local Funds in accordance with RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Act"},"other_fs":null,"project_status_id":"2","project_status":{"id":2,"name":"Proposed"},"updates":"This is a proposed project of PHilMech.

yield and good vigor rubber clone is one of the focuses in crop improvement. The information about phenotypic stability and adaptability is useful for the selection of crop varieties. These are identified by growing the rubber clones into different agro-climatic condition which has different response in genotypes as the environment condition changes. In rubber production the performance is represented by yield and growth stability. Plant breeders for years have been searching for a potential growth stability and high yield rubber production in different areas and locations. Furthermore, a genotype is considered stable when its performance across environments does not deviate from the average performance of group standard genotypes.\r\n\r\nThus, potential clones evolved in different countries under Multilateral Clone Exchange Program are being introduced to the member countries and evaluate under the local agro-climatic conditions. The adaptable promising selected clones that are resistance to biotic and abiotic stress that can produce high yield in specific location in the Philippines will be recommended for large planting. Hence, the Adaptability and Performance Trial of IRRDB exchange Clones in the Philippines will be conducted to test its adaptability and performance by Genotype-Environment Interaction and Phenotypic stability. This procedure will test the capabilities and abilities of the different Rubber clones that are under the Multilateral Clone Exchange Program when it comes to pest and diseases resistance while at the same time produced a high yield.

brasiliensis Muell.Arg.), is a thriving industry in the Philippines. Ranked among the world\u2019s to the top eight (8) rubber producing countries, the Philippines accounted for nearly 1% of the world\u2019s total dry rubber production of 91 million tonnes (Philippine Statistics Authority 2017). However, despite this production growth, the country\u2019s rubber industry sector is facing a shortage due to some of the problems in rubber-growing provinces in the Philippines. One of the reasons why there is a shortage of rubber production in the Philippines today is due to the very low latex yield per hectare. One of the problems encountered by the rubber growers which greatly affected their production is the preference of using low yielding clones, many occurring diseases, also from abusive tapping practices wherein the flow of rubber latex stops permanently. Weed interference that result of weed competition for light, CO2, water, nutrients, and space, as well as of the allelopathic effects of some weed species, is an important issue reducing plant growth and, consequently, increasing the time required for the plants to reach maturity (Vollmann et al. 2010, Rabbani et al. 2011). In connection to this, methods like cover-cropping which modify crop environment to make it less favorable for the growth and development of weeds. It certain cases have a great effect on weed control. Planting of cover crops (Mucuna bracteata) may commence before or after the establishment of rubber seedlings in the field. They grow quickly and form a thick cover on the soil surface. This suppresses weed growth in addition to providing nitrogen, increasing organic matter, and preventing soil erosion (Tangonan, 2012). Due to the importance and the lack of information regarding the effects of weed interference on rubber tree plantations, this research study will be conducted aiming (i) to evaluate the growth, girth size and latex yield of high yielding clones of rubber tree intercropped with cover crops in immature stage, (ii) to determine the efficacy of cover crops for weed management in immature stage during the establishment of a rubber tree plantation, (iii) to test and determine the soil fertility of rubber plantation intercropped with leguminous cover crops.","expected_outputs":"To evaluate the growth, girth size and latex yield of high yielding rubber clones intercropped with covercrops.

industrial crops grown mostly in Mindanao regions where rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, and this area is not frequently visited by strong winds and typhoons. It is of major economic importance because its sap \u2013 like extract known as latex can be collected and is the primary source of natural rubber its mechanical properties, natural rubber is an important and strategic raw material for the tire and electric industries (Le Roux et. al., 2000). However, the country\u2019s rubber industry sector is facing a shortage due to some of the diseases in rubber-growing provinces in the Philippines. Diseases of rubber could prevent and reduce the full yield potential in the rubber industry. The rubber tree is subject to a plethora of economically important pathological problems, mainly of fungal origin Basidiomycetes (Igeleke as cited by Omorusi, 2012). Diseases of rubber could prevent and reduce the full yield potential in the rubber industry. One of the most devastating diseases is White root rot caused by Rigidoporus lignosus, with the initial symptom of leaf yellowing and later dieback Tangonan N.G. (2012). Serious infection of immature stage results in growth retardation and susceptible clones, the whole tree dies within 3-4 weeks. For tapping trees, severe infection induces low latex production and even causes tapping panel dryness (Nghia et al, 2012). In the Philippines, White Root Rot Disease caused Rigidoporus lignosus, is regarded as the most serious disease affecting the roots of rubber trees in all stages from seedling to mature trees. The disease was first reported in the Philippines by (Tangonan et al 1996). On the other hand, disease management options or disease control interventions must be observed in an integrated approach to managing or controlling such diseases is suggested. It must be pointed out, however, that through land preparation and sanitation employing the recommended practices assure a practical approach to crop protection. Biological control is one of the practical approaches using mycoparasites to destroy existing sclerotia or inhibit the formation of the new sclerotia by the fungus population of the soil. So far, some of these biocontrols are being used by some growers on their crops but not widely accepted and limited to rubber, yet practical biological control recommendations are already developed (Agrios, 2005). Hence, this study will be conducted to determine the commercial biological control agents against white root rot disease (WRRD) in rubber plantation. This will also aims to promote the use of biocontrol measures in controlling rubber diseases which is environment-friendly approach compared to the usual use of rubber farmers of chemical fungicides.","expected_outputs":"To determine the response of Rigidoporus lignosus against different commercial biological agents in vitro and in-vivo.

The upgrading plan on ZamPen Rubber Testing Laboratory is affiliated to the mandate of Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) whereas, one of the order focuses on the assurance of the quality of rubber in the country. The total functionality of the laboratory will suffice the need of a natural rubber testing laboratory in the country. At the same manner, it is imperative that the technological upgrade of the laboratory will serve as provision for the conferment of ISO\/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation. The mission is to provide greatly the needed additional rubber testing laboratory in the country. Aid individual-, cooperatives-, small- and large-scale rubber processors in ensuring the Standard Philippine Rubber (SPR) specifications are conformed to the laboratory testing services. Moreover, PRRI researchers, SUC\u2019s, and other individual researchers can utilize the rubber testing laboratory for the development of rubber industry.","expected_outputs":"The goal of this proposal is to renovate and upgrade the existing ZamPen rubber testing laboratory for research functionality purposes. At the same manner, upgrade will be a step in fulfilling the needs for state-of-the-art rubber testing laboratory in the country and to assist small- and large-scale processors in ensuring Standard Philippine Rubber (SPR) specifications are achieved with the provision of testing services and can offer proof on the condition and quality of rubber and rubber products in compliance to industry regulations and market requirements.","spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga

agro-industrial crops in the world, especially Southeast Asia and South Asia. About 80 percent is used for making tires. The rest includes industrial products like belts, hoses, tubes, linings and bearings, consumer products like balls, erasers and footwear, medical products like gloves and catheters, as well as seismic materials to name some. However, raw rubber processors and rubber farmers plays a great role in controlling the quality of produce rubber products. About 24 primary processors which are located in Mindanao. Most processors are situated in Cotabato and Zamboanga Sibugay with an estimated total capacity of at least 225 tons and 80 tons per day, respectively. Moreover, there are small rubber processors in\r\nCotabato producing between one to three tons rubber every month. There are major issues and concern that rubber processors faces such as high cost of production, inefficient rubber processing equipment, inadequate of milling standards of cup lumps and capability of rubber testing laboratories to perform the required test procedures for crumb rubber. With these constraints, the Philippine Rubber Research Institute will establish a village based rubber processing plants in order to help small scale rubber farmers produce rubber sheets. These small-scale processing plants are said to produce high grade rubber so as to increase their profits.","expected_outputs":"The main objective of this research is to increase at least 5% in annual real household incomes of rubber farmer beneficiaries, produce high grade rubber so as to increase the profits of rubber farmers. It also encourage rubber farmers to engage more in rubber farming, as well as widen the area of rubber plantations in order to produce more yield and so to increase income. Moreover, it aims to provide access to an improve technology, improve productivity and give value addition to improve resilience of farmers to price fluctuations.","spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga

Production","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":"This research proposal relates to a need of natural rubber industry to upgrade latex harvesting operations through substantial use of different tapping tools and reduce the technical difficulty of\r\nrubber workers, thereby improving the efficiency of rubber tappers and minimizing the cost of farm inputs. Currently, the method used in latex harvesting is still in use of 100 years of labor-tapping mode. The \"V\" shaped traditional tapping knife is not only labor-consuming, labor-intensive, but also for rubber workers of relatively high technical requirements difficult to control the tapping depth and thickness which could easily lead to notched shades, hurt quality cambium layers, resulting in the occurrence of disease, tapping panel dryness or other related bark diseases, thereby reducing the latex yield and greater loss to the production. Early invention was also used mechanical force to drive the front and rear retractable blade rubber bark were cut, although to some extent, reduce labor intensity tapping, but the efficiency is still low, not been able to promote the use in production. In recent years, domestic and invented bundled automatic tapping machine, although to a large extent can replace manual tapping, but cannot move because of its high cost, easily damaged and other defects in the wild, it is difficult to promote the production area application. Therefore, the current production is still mainly dependent on the traditional human-based tapping. But the traditional \"V\"-shaped knife on rubber workers relatively required high technical skills on rubber tapping which can be developed by rubber tappers in a number of years, to put a lot of technical training costs. Thus, there is a need to conduct a study on the different tapping tools as it influence the economic productivity of rubber farmers in the countryside.","expected_outputs":"The main purpose of this project is to showcase different tapping tools in the application of latex harvesting operations, and determine its economic viability over the traditional tapping tool used.\r\nThis will also help increase the skills development of rubber farmers by using tapping tools that are efficient in bark consumption of rubber trees; and it will also determine the economic return of investment (ROI) in using different rubber tapping tools.","spatial_coverage_id":"3","spatial_coverage":{"id":3,"name":"Region-Specific"},"regions":[{"id":9,"name":"Zamboanga

expansion of rubber plantation in the country were lack of supply of quality planting materials, low rubber production and productivity (Philippine Rubber Industry Roadmap 2017-2022). One of the function of Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) based on RA 10089 (an act creating Philippine Rubber Research Institute) is to propagate and promote quality rubber planting materials, enable rubber industry stakeholders particularly smallholder rubber farmers to have access to quality rubber trees seedlings and showcase modern production techniques and other support services. In addition, in Section 12 of RA 10089 stated that twenty-five 25% of PRRI budget will be allocated for seedling propagation and dispersal of rubber trees. This project aims to comprehensively realize the goals of human empowerment and economic development in the countryside through programs and projects that will increase rubber production in the country and improve the quality of life especially in poor rural communities that depend primarily in this industry. To ensure the success of the project, PRRI will strengthen the collaboration with Local Government Units (LGUs), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) to ensure the availability of planting areas for rubber in the country through the production and distribution of quality planting materials. With these, production support services activities like the production and distribution of quality rubber planting materials will be conducted to address the problems of insufficient quality planting materials for bud wood establishment, replanting purposes of senile rubber trees; and expansion of\r\nrubber areas. Thus, income of rubber farmers also increases. Also, nursery of PRRI will be maintained in order to propagate rubber planting materials that will used for the distribution and for the support of research and development activities. Procurement of motor vehicle will ease the delivery of rubber planting materials to ensure that all planting materials propagated will be delivered to all beneficiaries.","expected_outputs":"To

of Rubber Based Farming Technology","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":"One of the major problems in rubber production is the long unproductive period from planting to tapping which usually ranges from 6-8 years. This situation calls for an appropriate farming system that can generate income for the farmers during the vegetative development of rubber trees. In connection to this, in order to increase their income, the maximum utilization of land through integrated farming system offers the best solution. Integrated farming in rubber plantation is not a new agroforestry practice in the country. It has been traditionally carried out for a long time. The approach is based on the existence of surplus family labor, utilization of interspaces between the rows of rubber, availability of cheap and nutritious animal feed and presence of favorable microclimate for animal growth under the rubber. Also, new existing technologies in rubber production, management, and harvesting will be introduced to rubber farmers for possible adaptation of rubber technology practices to increase their production and economic life span of the rubber trees. Mechanization will also introduce for development of farm area (ploughing, harrowing, uprooting and contouring). Rubber based farming system is an initiative for rubber farmers to generate regular income during the immature stage of rubber trees and to support the rubber farmers that are affected by COVID-19 pandemic through distribution of farm inputs like vegetable crops and livestock to be integrated to rubber plantation toensure sufficient food supply. This technology will bring hope to rubber farmers to increase production at a lower cost. In order to further enhance knowledge on rubber matured technologies, PRRI in collaboration with\r\nInternational Rubber Research Development Board (IRRDB), will conduct international rubber conference which will be funded by both PRRI and IRRDB. In 2022, the Philippines was assigned\r\nto host the said conference which will be charge under training expenses.","expected_outputs":"1.

Ancestors of the present-day Philippine horse, which were either of Malay and Indian stock, were brought into the country by traders and travelers from Indonesia by way of Sulu or of Chinese bloodlines (Mackie, 1916). These horses were crossed to purebred horses brought in by successive colonizers with the purpose of improving the native breed as they were believed to be small in stature and considered not fit for military use. Horses that were considered \u201csmall\u201d were relegated to farm use, for hauling farm produce. Most of these horses were also depended upon as daily conveyance by those who cannot afford to own a horse.\n\nToday, horses still perform a significant role in agriculture and in our daily life. Known for their strength, speed, sure-footedness and intelligence, horses remain as the source of draft power in remote areas. The horse is also popular in equestrian sports such as racing, polo, pleasure-riding and rodeos which generate jobs that stimulate industry and promote tourism. When the need arises, it becomes an alternative source of protein and funds in emergency situations. Several towns still use horses to pull the calesa as an alternative to motorized transport and as a tool to promote tourism. Horse-fighting is also popular in some areas because of cultural practices. The horse is also expected to figure prominently in the promotion of agri-tourism. \n\nWith the important role of horses in Philippine agriculture, it is imperative that support be provided to harness its full potential as work animal, as a potential source of food and livelihood.\nThis project aims to conserve and improve the Philippine horse as a source draft power, food and livelihood.","expected_outputs":"1.

placed under the supervision of NVQSD for flexibility in the deployment of personnel to have easier coordination of veterinary services and quarantine strategies especially in times of epidemic threats and emergencies. The VQS serves as the frontliners on border protection; implement quarantine functions and regulate the movement of animals, their products and by-products including documentation and issuance of permit and commodity clearance for international, inter-regional, intra-regional and inter-island transport.\n\nTo carry out the mandated functions, VQS offices and strategic inspection posts are in place as follows: 16 Regional Veterinary Quarantine Stations, covering 133 terrestrial quarantine checkpoints, 128 domestic seaports, 9 international seaports, 25 domestic airports, 10 international airports and 4 satellite offices at NAIA, North Harbor, MICP and South Harbor. With the continuous threat of animal disease incursion from important notifiable diseases such as FMD and Avian Influenza amid continuing ASF disease challenge there is a need to strengthen border control strategies. To sustain the implementation of veterinary quarantine inspection procedures and regulations, adequate manpower, facilities and tools are critical. \n\nThe NVQS aims to enhance the delivery of services and its implementation of regulatory functions by (1)improving its facilities and inspection methods; (2)automate applications for local movement clearance and export veterinary health certificates to enhance client services delivery; (3)adapt technology that will enable efficient collation of movement data for the ease of backtracking and forecasting, particularly in the event of disease emergencies; (4) training and employee development; and (5)incorporate epidemiological studies on the introduction and spread of ASF, review the effectiveness of national and local government for controlling the spread of disease and assess the National Zoning Plan for better management of the disease. \n\nTo achieve the said objectives, the improvement program on the following areas are determined:\n\n1.\tVeterinary Quarantine Stations border improvement \n 1.1 Installation of Mobile Vehicle Disinfection Machine in key interregional checkpoints \n1.2 Institutionalization of foot mat in international and domestic ports \n1.3 Institutionalization of K9 sniffing dogs in critical ports in collaboration with the Philippine Coast Guard.\n1.4 Establishment of Ecologically, Economically acceptable and Sustainable Disposal system for confiscated commodities \n1.5. Establishment of a veterinary quarantine isolation center in Tanay, Rizal\n1.6 Veterinary Quarantine Policy Development\n\n2. Upgrading, expansion and maintenance of NVQS website and Online clearance application system\n2.1 Creation of Public Consultation online hub for new proposed policies\/guidelines of the NVQS\n\n3. Epidemiological Study on ASF and assessment of ASF disease control strategies to be done by 3rd party experts\n3.1 Establishment of Risk Assessment Unit under NVQS \n\n4. Personnel Enhancement Program & Stakeholder Engagement\n4.1 Retooling of NVQS Personnel\n4.2 Updating\/Orientation seminar for Clients \n4.3 Specialized Training of Veterinarians and other technical personnel\n4.4 Participation of employees to continuing education activities\n4.5 Public Consultation\n\n5. Hiring of additional Contract of Service Personnel to support  NVQS & VQS operations\nTo enhance the delivery of quarantine services and efficient implementation of qurantine regulatory functions to prevent the entry\/incursion of Transboundry animal diseases and control the spread of African Swine Fever disease in the country \n\nThe effective control and prevention of ASF and other TADs cases will eventually lead to regaining the ASF country freedom status and maintain the country\u2019s freedom status for TADs such as FMD and Avian Influenza.","expected_outputs":"improved National

Program of the Bureau of Animal Industry is the low level of awareness of farm owners and the non-mandatory state of the program which leads to low compliance from commercial farms and lack of GAHP standards for backyard farms.\n \nFood borne illnesses are usually caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances entering the body through contaminated food or water. To minimize the risks of food contamination, action is needed at all stages of the food chain, therefore early detection through laboratory tests will help us for the detection of food borne hazards of animal origin at the primary production phase.\n\nThis proposal is a way to minimize risks of food borne illnesses at the primary production phase and incentivize the certification program through provisions of free diagnostic test for the detection of food borne hazards and antimicrobial residues for GAHP certified farms.\n\n\nWith the approval of the Strategic Plan of the Food Safety Regulatory Agencies of the Department of Agriculture last October 2018. The Strategic Plan was summarized based on the Five (5) Pillars of Food Safety namely: Rules and Regulations, Food Control System, Enforcement Services, Laboratory and Epidemiological Data and Information, Education, Communication and Training.\n\nThis proposal aims for the following:\n\u2022\tTo facilitate the early detection, management and control of animal diseases in farms by providing free testing for GAHP certified farms for:\n\u2022\tSwine farms\n\uf0a7\tTrichenella\n\uf0a7\tAfrican Swine Fever\n\uf0a7\tHog Cholera\n\uf0a7\tBrucellosis\n\uf0a7\tTransmissible Gastroenteritis

products are free from any food borne hazards or antimicrobial residues (banned and\/or regulated)\n\u2022\tSalbutamol\n\u2022\tTetracycline\n\u2022\tChloramphenicol\n\tTo create a data for resistant pathogens, as part of antimicrobial use control and surveillance.\n\t\n\tTo comply with the provisions of the Republic Act 10611, also known as the Food Safety Act of 2013, which was created to protect and promote the right to health of the people by maintaining a farm to fork food safety regulatory system that ensures a high level of food safety, among others; and Department Circular No. 7

Optimization, Validation and Adoption of Available Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for the Rapid Detection of selected economic (highly invasive) pests and diseases for ASEAN Member Countries","pap_type_id":"2","pap_type":{"id":2,"name":"Project"},"regular_program":false,"description":"The Philippines has existing policies (Presidential Decree No. 1433) that would protect the export and import of agricultural products and commodities from harboring harmful pests and diseases. Consignments are subjected to quarantine inspection or verification to determine their phytosanitary condition. Importations that have been verified to be free from any of the quarantine pests and diseases shall be released to the importer upon the authorization of Plant Quarantine Officer. Similarly, domestic movement of agricultural products harboring insect pests and diseases are restricted unless freedom from pests is ensured or specific treatment is employed.\r\n\r\nNormally, quarantine inspection and laboratory examination typically lasts for 3-10 days depending on the type of test conducted. As a result, some products are hold in the port area that will cause a delay for their target date of shipment or release if found to contain damaging pest and diseases. \r\n\r\nIt was reported that one of the goals of ASEAN is to expand the trading opportunities of its member countries. Although, it will help ASEAN member countries to fully enhance their products, be engaged to various trading opportunities and to become globally competitive, member countries acknowledge the risk of introduction of exotic pests and diseases into their respective countries due to increasing volume of traded commodities that poses a significant threat on the agricultural industry (Capistrano, 2017).\r\n\r\nIn view of this, four (4) highly invasive insect pests and diseases which can pose a serious threat to agricultural industry in ASEAN member states have to be monitored to prevent its entry and spread in the entire region. These are Drosophila suzukii(spotted wing drosophila),Ceratitis capitate (Mediterranean fruit fly), Pseudomonas syringaepv. syringae (bacterial canker) and Cassava mosaic virus (CMV).  If not regulated properly and detection protocol is inefficient, the risk of its introduction to the Philippines and to other ASEAN member countries is imminent and ultimately threatens food security.\r\n\r\nIn addressing this pressing concern on invasive pests, BPI-NPQSD, with an established MBL that employs molecular techniques, realizes the importance of adoption of rapid detection protocol for the identified pests using available Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay. LAMP is regarded as an innovative gene amplification technology as substitute to PCR-based methodologies. It has been applied for the detection and identification of plant pathogens and other microorganisms that showed significant advantage due to its high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity. The most promising feature of this technology is the rapid and robust detection of the target nucleic acid without requiring sophisticated equipment. Reactions can be performed with limited resources, using a water bath for incubation and detection of results by the naked eye (colorimetric method) wherein it can give results that is comparable to modern PCR-based techniques (Li et al., 2017).\r\n\r\nThe said methods can be optimized and validated not only for the future use of the Bureau but also for the ASEAN member countries. Moreover, in pursuing an inclusive approach to accelerate the transformation towards a modern and industrialized Philippine agriculture, the Department of Agriculture (DA) is implementing critical strategies for 2021 (DA Communications Group, 2021a). One of the twelve (12) key strategies to firm up the \u2018One DA\u2019 framework is the \u201cIntensification of Food Safety Protocols and Regulations\u2019 (DA Communications Group, 2021b). As per this strategy, the DA will focus its funding and effort in mitigating the effects of plants and animal diseases through improvement of laboratory and research facilities, building traceability, and unifying control measures against plant and animal epidemics (DA Website). This project is highly supportive with this strategy through strengthening the regulatory capability of the division and improvement of effectivity and efficiency of detection of pest of quarantine significance.","expected_outputs":"Optimized, verified and validated LAMP protocols for the rapid detection of selected economic pests and

LC-MS-MS -  for screening and confirmation of almost all types of pesticides\r\n2. GC-FPD - for analysis of low molecular weight organo-phosphorus containing pesticides\r\n3. GC-ECD -  for analysis of low molecular weight organo-chlorine containing   pesticides and pyrethroids\r\n4. Medical freezers \u2013 for storage of pesticide standards and samples\r\n5.

In addition, hands on training, maintenance and troubleshooting, evaluation and interpretation of the data obtained will also be conducted. These trainings are part of the package in the procurement of the equipment.\r\n\r\nMethod development and validation of analytical methods will be conducted as soon as the equipment are installed. The method development will be done on a per instrument basis while validation will be on a crop \/ pesticide basis and will follow international protocol in order to produce reliable and accurate results.  Actual implementation of the project will be conducted through the analysis of crops (300 samples for the whole project duration) both imported and local.  Monitoring of imported commodities, particularly apples, pears, oranges and grapes, consumed fresh will be conducted in local markets and in borders through the National Plant Quarantine Services Division (NPQSD).  Monitoring of commodities in the local markets will be enhanced.  This enhanced monitoring will ensure safe food for the Filipinos as well ensure detection of pesticide residues prior to exportation of crops, thereby resulting to reduced detections and detentions of our commodities in importing countries.","expected_outputs":"Procurement of additional equipment and validation of methods to cater for additional target analytes in the analysis of local and imported

2013-2016 implemented through a project titled, \u201cEnhancing the Capacity for Production and Distribution of High-Quality Rice Seeds\u201d. As PhilRice CES  expanded its area for seed production, from 34 hectares in 2016-2020 to 52 hectares, it will require additional facility to complement and sustain performance efficiency. \r\n\r\nConcerns on untagged seeds that are proliferating will partly be addressed by the rice seed information system (RSIS) which is a component of this project. With RSIS portal serving as repository of important data\/information, the stakeholders will be guided as to the availability of high-quality seeds which can be accessed anytime.\r\n\r\nThe NFA\u2019s ICT-based buffer stock management system, on the other hand, will need the hardware and software to improve its operations. It will equip the personnel with gadget and in using the ICT software so they can provide the status of milled rice inventories in the regional warehouses at a given time. The stakeholders will be kept abreast of the situation of each of the NFA stations so augmentation of stocks from one place to another may be facilitated within reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nOnce these facilities, systems, and hardware are in place, the Philippine government will be kept informed for planning and decision making on matters pertaining to rice production and seed requirements and sources, palay procurement schedules, and milled rice stocking and distribution system. Hence, this project will\r\nprovide great contribution and impact to achieving a seed-secure toward a food-secure Philippines.\"","expected_outputs":"1.

through the infusion of purebred and crossbred dairy stocks, use of advanced breeding technologies and establishment\/strengthening of community-based dairy enterprises within identified impact dairy zones. This is in support to the Department of Agriculture (DA)\u2019s current development strategy of \u201cNew Thinking for Agriculture\u201d and new vision of a \u201cfood secure Philippines with prosperous farmers and fishers\u201d. Moreover, the farm consolidation or clustering approach will be done encouraging farmers to consolidate\/cluster their dairy animal farming activities thereby enhancing access of these farmers to technologies, financing and markets. \r\n\r\nConsistent with the objectives of the agriculture sector in expanding economic opportunities in agriculture, the project aims to: 1) produce 27.70 Million Liters of milk throughout the project period; 2) increase dairy cattle inventory by 7,323 heads and dairy goat inventory by 9,611 heads through importation and expanded animal breeding programs; 3) increase dairy carabao inventory by 922 heads through importation and local procurement of purebred\/crossbred buffaloes; 4) increase production of female calf by 8,562 heads annually through expanded AI services utilizing the semen sexing technology; 5) increase average family income of dairy farmers by 20% annually through the development of carabao-based dairy enterprises; and 6) increase the average income of dairy goat farmers by 18% and double the income of dairy cattle farmers throughout the project period with the establishment and enhancement of goat-based and cattle-based dairy enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn laying down the strategies to be implemented throughout its duration, the following are the major components of the project: a) Dairy Animal Procurement and Distribution; b) Expanded Artificial Insemination; c) Feed Production and Development; d) Dairy Enterprise Development; e) Capacity Building; and f) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will be implemented by the National Dairy Authority (NDA) and Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) with the DA-National Livestock Program (NLP) as the oversight office for four (4) years.

This is in support to the Department of Agriculture (DA)\u2019s current development strategy of \u201cNew Thinking for Agriculture\u201d and new vision of a \u201cfood secure Philippines with prosperous farmers and fishers\u201d. Moreover, the farm consolidation or clustering approach will be done encouraging farmers to consolidate\/cluster their dairy animal farming activities thereby enhancing access of these farmers to technologies, financing and markets. Consistent with the objectives of the agriculture sector in expanding economic opportunities in agriculture, the project aims to: 1) produce 27.70 Million Liters of milk throughout the project period; 2) increase dairy cattle inventory by 7,323 heads and dairy goat inventory by 9,611 heads through importation and expanded animal breeding programs; 3) increase dairy carabao inventory by 922 heads through importation and local procurement of purebred\/crossbred buffaloes; 4) increase production of female calf by 8,562 heads annually through expanded AI services utilizing the semen sexing technology; 5) increase average family income of dairy farmers by 20% annually through the development of carabao-based dairy enterprises; and 6) increase the average income of dairy goat farmers by 18% and double the income of dairy cattle farmers throughout the project period with the establishment and enhancement of goat-based and cattle-based dairy enterprises. In laying down the strategies to be implemented throughout its duration, the following are the major components of the project: a) Dairy Animal Procurement and Distribution; b) Expanded Artificial Insemination; c) Feed Production and Development; d) Dairy Enterprise Development; e) Capacity Building; and f) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will be implemented by the National Dairy Authority (NDA) and Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) with the DA-National Livestock Program (NLP) as the oversight office for four (4) years. It will be sustained and monitored through collaborations with various cooperating agencies.","expected_outputs":"As envisioned, this program shall impact the local dairy industry and the lives of the direct and indirect beneficiaries.
